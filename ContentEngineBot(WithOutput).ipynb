It led us to be a pioneer in the development of AI and, since 2016, \\nan AI-first company. We continue this work under the leadership of Alphabet and Google CEO, Sundar Pichai.\\nAlphabet is a collection of businesses — the largest of which is Google. We report Google in two segments, \\nGoogle Services and Google Cloud, and all non-Google businesses collectively as Other Bets. Alphabet\\'s structure is \\nabout helping each of our businesses prosper through strong leaders and independence. \\nAccess and Technology for Everyone\\nThe Internet is one of the world’s most powerful equalizers; it propels ideas, people, and businesses large and \\nsmall. Our mission to organize the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful is as relevant \\ntoday as it was when we were founded in 1998. Since then, we have evolved from a company that helps people find \\nanswers to a company that also helps people get things done. \\nWe are focused on building an even more helpful Google for everyone, and we aspire to give everyone the tools \\nthey need to increase their knowledge, health, happiness, and success. Google Search helps people find information \\nand make sense of the world in more natural and intuitive ways, with trillions of searches on Google every year. \\nYouTube provides people with entertainment, information, and opportunities to learn something new. Google Assistant \\noffers the best way to get things done seamlessly across different devices, providing intelligent help throughout a \\nperson\\'s day, no matter where they are. Google Cloud helps customers solve today’s business challenges, improve \\nproductivity, reduce costs, and unlock new growth engines. We are continually innovating and building new products \\nand features that will help our users, partners, customers, and communities and have invested more than $150 billion \\nin research and development in the last five years in support of these efforts.\\nMaking AI Helpful for Everyone\\nAI is a transformational technology that can bring meaningful and positive change to people and societies across \\nthe world, and for our business. At Google, we have been bringing AI into our products and services for more than a \\ndecade and making them available to our users. Our journey began in 2001, when machine learning was first \\nincorporated into Google Search to suggest better spellings to users searching the web. Today, AI in our products is \\nTable of Contents\\nAlphabet Inc.\\n4.  \\nused by billions of people globally through features like autocomplete suggestions in Google Search; translation across \\n133 languages in Google Translate; and organization, searching, and editing in Google Photos.\\nLarge language models (LLMs) are an exciting aspect of our work in AI based on deep learning architectures, \\nsuch as the Transformer, a neural network architecture that we introduced in 2017 that helped with language \\nunderstanding. This led to the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers, or BERT, in 2019 that helped \\nSearch understand the intent of user search queries better than ever before.\\nGoogle was a company built in the cloud, and we continue to invest in our Google Cloud offerings, including \\nGoogle Cloud Platform and Google Workspace, to help organizations stay at the forefront of AI innovation with our AI-\\noptimized infrastructure, mature AI platform and world-class models, and assistive agents.\\nWe believe AI can solve some of the hardest societal, scientific and engineering challenges of our time. For \\nexample, in 2020, Google DeepMind’s AlphaFold system solved a 50-year-old protein folding challenge. Since then, \\nwe have open-sourced to the scientific community 200 million of AlphaFold’s protein structures which are used to work \\non everything from accelerating new malaria vaccines to advancing cancer drug discovery and developing plastic-\\neating enzymes. As another example, AI can also have a transformative effect on climate progress by providing helpful \\ninformation, predicting climate-related events, and optimizing climate action. Using advanced AI and geospatial \\nanalysis, Google Research has developed flood forecasting models that can provide early warning and real-time \\nflooding information to communities and individuals. \\nAs AI continues to improve rapidly, we are focused on giving helpful features to our users and customers as we \\ndeliver on our mission to organize the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful. With a bold \\nand responsible approach, we continue to take the next steps to make this technology even more helpful for everyone.\\nDeliver the Most Advanced, Safe, and Responsible AI\\nWe aim to build the most advanced, safe, and responsible AI with models that are developed, trained, and \\nrigorously tested at scale powered by our continued investment in AI technical infrastructure. In December 2023, we \\nlaunched Gemini, our most capable and general model. It was built from the ground up to be multimodal, which means \\nit can generalize and seamlessly understand, operate across, and combine different types of information, including \\ntext, code, audio, images, and video. Our teams across Alphabet will leverage Gemini, as well as other AI models we \\nhave previously developed and announced, across our business to deliver the best product and service experiences \\nfor our users, advertisers, partners, customers, and developers.\\nWe believe our approach to AI must be both bold and responsible. That means developing AI in a way that \\nmaximizes the positive benefits to society while addressing the challenges, guided by our AI Principles. We published \\nthese in 2018, as one of the first companies to articulate principles that put beneficial use, users, safety, and avoidance \\nof harms above business considerations. While there is natural tension between being bold and being responsible, we \\nbelieve it is possible — and in fact critical — to embrace that tension productively.\\nEnable Organizations and Developers to Innovate on Google Cloud\\nAI is not only a powerful enabler, it is also a major platform shift. Globally, businesses from startups to large \\nenterprises, and the public sector are thinking about how to drive transformation. That is why we are focused on \\nmaking it easy and scalable for others to innovate, and grow, with AI. That means providing the most advanced \\ncomputing infrastructure and expanding access to Google’s latest AI models that have been rigorously tested in our \\nown products. Our Vertex AI platform gives developers the ability to train, tune, augment, and deploy applications using \\ngenerative AI models and services such as Enterprise Search and Conversations. Duet AI for Google Cloud provides \\npre-packaged AI agents that assist developers to write, test, document, and operate software.\\nImprove Knowledge, Learning, Creativity, and Productivity\\nThings that we now consider routine – like spell check, mobile check deposit, or Google Search, Google \\nTranslate, and Google Maps – all use AI. As AI continues to improve rapidly, we are focused on giving helpful features \\nto our users as we continue to deliver on our mission to organize the world’s information and make it universally \\naccessible and useful.\\nWhile we have been integrating AI into our products for years, we are now embedding the power of generative AI \\nto continue helping our users express themselves and get things done. For example, Duet AI in Google Workspace \\nhelps users write, organize, visualize, accelerate workflows, and have richer meetings. Bard allows users to \\ncollaborate with experimental AI with new features that include image capabilities, coding support, and app integration. \\nDream Screen, a new experimental feature in YouTube, allows for the creation of AI-generated video or image \\nbackgrounds to Shorts by typing an idea into a prompt.\\nTable of Contents\\nAlphabet Inc.\\n5.  \\nWe also know businesses of all sizes around the world rely on Google Ads to find customers and grow their \\nbusinesses — and we make that even easier with AI. With Performance Max, advertisers simply tell us their campaign \\ngoals and share their creative assets, and AI will automatically produce and run a highly effective ad campaign across \\nall of Google’s properties, to meet their budget. Product Studio brings the benefits of AI to businesses of all sizes, \\nhelping them easily create uniquely-tailored imagery featuring their products — for free. Additionally, we are \\nexperimenting with Search and Shopping ads that are directly integrated into the AI-powered snapshot and \\nconversational mode in Search Generative Experience.\\nBuild the Most Helpful Personal Computing Platforms and Devices\\nOver the years, our Pixel phones have incorporated AI compute directly into the device and built experiences on \\ntop of it. Our latest Pixel devices were built around AI, bringing the best AI-assistive experiences to our users, such as \\nBest Take, Magic Editor, and Audio Magic Eraser. As we look ahead, we are designing our Android and Chrome \\noperating systems with new AI-forward user experiences. \\nMoonshots\\nMany companies get comfortable doing what they have always done, making only incremental changes. This \\nincrementalism leads to irrelevance over time, especially in technology, where change tends to be revolutionary, not \\nevolutionary. People thought we were crazy when we acquired YouTube and Android and when we launched Chrome, \\nbut those efforts have matured into major platforms for digital video and mobile devices and a safer, popular browser. \\nOur early investments in AI started out as moonshots but are now incorporated into our core products and central to \\nfuture developments. We continue to look toward the future and to invest for the long term, most notably for the \\napplication of AI to our products and services, as well as other frontier technologies such as quantum computing. As \\nwe said in the original founders\\' letter, we will not shy away from high-risk, high-reward projects that we believe in, as \\nthey are the key to our long-term success.\\nPrivacy and Security\\nWe make it a priority to protect the privacy and security of our products, users, and customers, even if there are \\nnear-term financial consequences. We do this by continuously investing in building products that are secure by default; \\nstrictly upholding responsible data practices that emphasize privacy by design; and building easy-to-use settings that \\nput people in control. We are continually enhancing these efforts over time, whether by enabling users to auto-delete \\ntheir data, giving them tools, such as My Ad Center, to control their ad experience, or advancing anti-malware, anti-\\nphishing, and password security features.\\nGoogle\\nFor reporting purposes Google comprises two segments: Google Services and Google Cloud.\\nGoogle Services\\nServing Our Users\\nWe have always been committed to building helpful products that can improve the lives of millions of people \\nworldwide. Our product innovations are what make our services widely used, and our brand one of the most \\nrecognized in the world. Google Services\\' core products and platforms include ads, Android, Chrome, devices, Gmail, \\nGoogle Drive, Google Maps, Google Photos, Google Play, Search, and YouTube, with broad and growing adoption by \\nusers around the world.\\nOur products and services have come a long way since the company was founded more than 25 years ago. \\nWhile Google Search started as a way to find web pages, organized into ten blue links, we have driven technical \\nadvancements and product innovations that have transformed Google Search into a dynamic, multimodal experience. \\nWe first expanded from traditional desktop browsers into mobile web search, making it easier to navigate on smaller \\nscreens. As new types of content surfaced on the internet, Universal Search made it possible to search multiple \\ncontent types, like news, images, videos, and more, to deliver rich, relevant results. The introduction of new search \\nmodalities, like voice and visual search, made it easier for people to express their curiosity in natural and intuitive \\nways. We took that a step further with multisearch, which lets people search with text and images at the same time. \\nLarge language models like BERT and Multitask Unified Models, or MUMs, have made it possible to express more \\nnatural language queries, vastly improving the quality of results. Each advancement has made it easier and more \\nnatural for people to find what they are looking for.\\nThis drive to make information more accessible and helpful has led us over the years to improve the discovery \\nand creation of digital content both on the web and through platforms like Google Play and YouTube. People are \\nconsuming many forms of digital content, including watching videos, streaming TV, playing games, listening to music, \\nTable of Contents\\nAlphabet Inc.\\n6.  \\nreading books, and using apps. Working with content creators and partners, we continue to build new ways for people \\naround the world to create and find great digital content.\\nFueling all of these great digital experiences are extraordinary platforms and devices. That is why we continue to \\ninvest in platforms like our Android mobile operating system, Chrome browser, and Chrome operating system, as well \\nas growing our family of devices. We see tremendous potential for devices to be helpful and make people\\'s lives easier \\nby combining the best of our AI, software, and hardware. This potential is reflected in our latest generation of devices, \\nsuch as the new Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro, and the Pixel Watch 2. Creating products and services that people rely on \\nevery day is a journey that we are investing in for the long-term.\\nHow We Make Money\\nWe have built world-class advertising technologies for advertisers, agencies, and publishers to power their digital \\nmarketing businesses. Our advertising solutions help millions of companies grow their businesses through our wide \\nrange of products across devices and formats, and we aim to ensure positive user experiences by serving the right ads \\nat the right time and by building deep partnerships with brands and agencies. AI has been foundational to our \\nadvertising business for more than a decade. Products like Performance Max and Product Studio use the full power of \\nour AI to help advertisers find untapped and incremental conversion opportunities.\\nGoogle Services generates revenues primarily by delivering both performance and brand advertising that appears \\non Google Search & other properties, YouTube, and Google Network partners\\' properties (\"Google Network \\nproperties\"). We continue to invest in both performance and brand advertising and seek to improve the measurability of \\nadvertising so advertisers understand the effectiveness of their campaigns.\\n•\\nPerformance advertising creates and delivers relevant ads that users will click on leading to direct \\nengagement with advertisers. Performance advertising lets our advertisers connect with users while driving \\nmeasurable results. Our ads tools allow performance advertisers to create simple text-based ads.\\n•\\nBrand advertising helps enhance users\\' awareness of and affinity for advertisers\\' products and services, \\nthrough videos, text, images, and other interactive ads that run across various devices. We help brand \\nadvertisers deliver digital videos and other types of ads to specific audiences for their brand-building marketing \\ncampaigns. \\nWe have allocated substantial resources to stopping bad advertising practices and protecting users on the web. \\nWe focus on creating the best advertising experiences for our users and advertisers in many ways, including filtering \\nout invalid traffic, removing billions of bad ads from our systems every year, and closely monitoring the sites, apps, and \\nvideos where ads appear and blocklisting them when necessary to ensure that ads do not fund bad content.\\nIn addition, Google Services increasingly generates revenues from products and services beyond advertising, \\nincluding:\\n•\\nconsumer subscriptions, which primarily include revenues from YouTube services, such as YouTube TV, \\nYouTube Music and Premium,  and NFL Sunday Ticket, as well as Google One;\\n•\\nplatforms, which primarily include revenues from Google Play from the sales of apps and in-app purchases; \\nand\\n•\\ndevices, which primarily include sales of the Pixel family of devices.\\nGoogle Cloud\\nThrough our Google Cloud Platform and Google Workspace offerings, Google Cloud generates revenues \\nprimarily from consumption-based fees and subscriptions for infrastructure, platform, collaboration tools and other \\ncloud services. Customers use five key capabilities from Google Cloud.\\n•\\nAI-optimized Infrastructure: provides open, reliable, and scalable compute, networking, and storage to \\nenable customers to run workloads anywhere — on our Cloud, at the edge, or in their data centers. It can be \\nused to migrate and modernize IT systems and to train and serve various types of AI models. \\n•\\nCybersecurity: helps customers detect, protect, and respond to a broad range of cybersecurity threats, with \\nAI integrated to further strengthen security outcomes, prioritize which threats to investigate, and identify attack \\npaths, as well as accelerate resolution of cybersecurity threats. \\n•\\nDatabases and Analytics: provides a variety of different types of databases — relational, key-value, in-\\nmemory — to store and manage data for different types of applications. Our Data Cloud also unifies data \\nlakes, data warehouses, data governance, and advanced machine learning into a single platform that can \\nanalyze data across any cloud.\\nTable of Contents\\nAlphabet Inc.\\n7.  \\n•\\nCollaboration Tools: Google Workspace and Duet AI in Google Workspace provide easy-to-use, secure \\ncommunication and collaboration tools, including apps like Gmail, Docs, Drive, Calendar, Meet, and more. \\nThese tools enable secure hybrid and remote work, boosting productivity and collaboration. AI has been used \\nin Google Workspace for years to improve grammar, efficiency, security, and more with features like Smart \\nReply, Smart Compose, and malware and phishing protection in Gmail. Duet AI in Google Workspace helps \\nusers write, organize, visualize, accelerate workflows, and have richer meetings.\\n•\\nAI Platform and Duet AI for Google Cloud: Our Vertex AI platform gives developers the ability to train, tune, \\naugment, and deploy applications using generative AI models and services such as Enterprise Search and \\nConversations. Duet AI for Google Cloud provides pre-packaged AI agents that assist developers to write, test, \\ndocument, and operate software.\\nOther Bets\\n Across Alphabet, we are also using technology to try to solve big problems that affect a wide variety of industries \\nfrom improving transportation and health technology to exploring solutions to address climate change. Alphabet’s \\ninvestment in the portfolio of Other Bets includes businesses that are at various stages of development, ranging from \\nthose in the R&D phase to those that are in the beginning stages of commercialization. Our goal is for them to become \\nthriving, successful businesses. Other Bets operate as independent companies and some of them have their own \\nboards with independent members and outside investors. While these early-stage businesses naturally come with \\nconsiderable uncertainty, some of them are already generating revenue and making important strides in their \\nindustries. Revenues from Other Bets are generated primarily from the sale of healthcare-related services and internet \\nservices.\\nCompetition\\nOur business is characterized by rapid change as well as new and disruptive technologies. We face formidable \\ncompetition in every aspect of our business, including, among others, from:\\n•\\ngeneral purpose search engines and information services;\\n•\\nvertical search engines and e-commerce providers for queries related to travel, jobs, and health, which users \\nmay navigate directly to rather than go through Google;\\n•\\nonline advertising platforms and networks;\\n•\\nother forms of advertising, such as billboards, magazines, newspapers, radio, and television as our advertisers \\ntypically advertise in multiple media, both online and offline;\\n•\\ndigital content and application platform providers;\\n•\\nproviders of enterprise cloud services;\\n•\\ndevelopers and providers of AI products and services;\\n•\\ncompanies that design, manufacture, and market consumer hardware products, including businesses that \\nhave developed proprietary platforms;\\n•\\nproviders of digital video services; \\n•\\nsocial networks, which users may rely on for product or service referrals, rather than seeking information \\nthrough traditional search engines;\\n•\\nproviders of workspace communication and connectivity products; and \\n•\\ndigital assistant providers.\\nCompeting successfully depends heavily on our ability to develop and distribute innovative products and \\ntechnologies to the marketplace across our businesses. For example, for advertising, competing successfully depends \\non attracting and retaining:\\n•\\nusers, for whom other products and services are literally one click away, largely on the basis of the relevance \\nof our advertising, as well as the general usefulness, security, and availability of our products and services;\\n•\\nadvertisers, primarily based on our ability to generate sales leads, and ultimately customers, and to deliver \\ntheir advertisements in an efficient and effective manner across a variety of distribution channels; and\\n•\\ncontent providers, primarily based on the quality of our advertiser base, our ability to help these partners \\ngenerate revenues from advertising, and the terms of our agreements with them.\\nTable of Contents\\nAlphabet Inc.\\n8.  \\nFor additional information about competition, see Item 1A Risk Factors of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. \\nOngoing Commitment to Sustainability\\nWe believe that every business has the opportunity and obligation to protect our planet. Sustainability is one of \\nour core values at Google, and we strive to build sustainability into everything we do. We have been a leader on \\nsustainability and climate change since Google’s founding more than 25 years ago. \\nOur sustainability work is focused on empowering individuals to take action, working together with our partners \\nand customers, and working to reduce our carbon footprint across our operations and supply chain.\\nIn 2020, we shared our aspiration to help individuals, cities, and other partners collectively reduce one gigaton of \\ntheir carbon equivalent emissions annually by 2030. This is an ambitious vision that we have set to push us to \\ncontribute meaningfully to helping with climate solutions beyond our own operations and value chain. \\nIn 2021, we set an ambitious goal to achieve net-zero emissions across all of our operations and value chain, by \\n2030. To accomplish this, we aim to reduce 50% of our combined Scope 1, Scope 2 (market-based), and Scope 3 \\nabsolute emissions (versus our 2019 baseline) before 2030, and plan to invest in nature-based and technology-based \\ncarbon removal solutions to neutralize our remaining emissions. We have formally committed to the Science Based \\nTargets initiative to seek their validation of our absolute emissions reduction target. \\nOne of the key levers for reducing emissions from our operations is transitioning to clean energy. Since 2017, we \\nhave matched 100% of the electricity consumption of our global operations with purchases of renewable energy on an \\nannual basis. However, because of differences in the availability of renewable energy sources like solar and wind \\nacross the regions where we operate—and because of the variable supply of these resources—we still need to rely on \\ncarbon-emitting energy sources that power local grids. That is why we set a goal to run on 24/7 carbon-free energy \\n(CFE) on every grid where we operate by 2030.\\nAchieving net-zero emissions and 24/7 CFE by 2030 are extremely ambitious goals. We also know that our path \\nto net-zero emissions will not be easy or linear. Some of our plans may take years to deliver results, particularly where \\nthey involve building new large-scale infrastructure with long lead times. So as our business continues to evolve, we \\nexpect our emissions to rise before dropping towards our absolute emissions reduction target.\\nTo benefit the people and places where we operate, we have set goals to replenish 120% of the freshwater \\nvolume we consume, on average, across our offices and data centers by 2030 and to help restore and improve the \\nquality of water and health of ecosystems in the communities where we operate. \\nWe also aim to maximize the reuse of finite resources across our operations, products, and supply chains. Our \\ncircularity principles focus on designing out waste from the start, keeping materials in use for as long as possible, and \\npromoting healthy materials—for our data centers, workplaces, and products.\\nMore information on our approach to sustainability can be found in our annual sustainability reports, including \\nGoogle’s Environmental Report. The contents of our sustainability reports are not incorporated by reference into this \\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K or in any other report or document we file with the SEC. For additional information about \\nrisks and uncertainties applicable to our commitments to attain certain sustainability goals, see Item 1A Risk Factors of \\nthis Annual Report on Form 10-K.\\nCulture and Workforce\\nWe are a company of curious, talented, and passionate people. We embrace collaboration and creativity, and \\nencourage the iteration of ideas to address complex challenges in technology and society.\\nOur people are critical for our continued success, so we work hard to create an environment where employees \\ncan have fulfilling careers, and be happy, healthy, and productive. We offer industry-leading benefits and programs to \\ntake care of the diverse needs of our employees and their families, including opportunities for career growth and \\ndevelopment, resources to support their financial health, and access to excellent healthcare choices. Our competitive \\ncompensation programs help us to attract and retain top candidates, and we will continue to invest in recruiting \\ntalented people to technical and non-technical roles, and rewarding them well. We provide a variety of high quality \\ntraining and support to managers to build and strengthen their capabilities-–ranging from courses for new managers, to \\nlearning resources that help them provide feedback and manage performance, to coaching and individual support.\\nAt Alphabet, we are committed to making diversity, equity, and inclusion part of everything we do and to growing a \\nworkforce that is representative of the users we serve. More information on Google’s approach to diversity can be \\nfound in our annual diversity reports, available publicly at diversity.google. The contents of our diversity reports are not \\nincorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K or in any other report or document we file with the \\nSEC.\\nTable of Contents\\nAlphabet Inc.\\n9.  \\n As of December 31, 2023, Alphabet had 182,502 employees. We have work councils and statutory employee \\nrepresentation obligations in certain countries, and we are committed to supporting protected labor rights, maintaining \\nan open culture, and listening to all employees. Supporting healthy and open dialogue is central to how we work, and \\nwe communicate information about the company through multiple internal channels to our employees.\\nWhen necessary we contract with businesses around the world to provide specialized services where we do not \\nhave appropriate in-house expertise or resources, often in fields that require specialized training like cafe operations, \\ncontent moderation, customer support, and physical security. We also contract with temporary staffing agencies when \\nwe need to cover short-term leaves, when we have spikes in business needs, or when we need to quickly incubate \\nspecial projects. We choose our partners and staffing agencies carefully, and review their compliance with Google’s \\nSupplier Code of Conduct. We continually make improvements to promote a respectful and positive working \\nenvironment for everyone — employees, vendors, and temporary staff alike.\\nGovernment Regulation\\nWe are subject to numerous United States (U.S.) federal, state, and local, as well as foreign laws and regulations \\ncovering a wide variety of subjects, and the scope of this coverage continues to broaden with continuing new legal and \\nregulatory developments in the U.S. and internationally. Like other companies in the technology industry, we face \\nincreasingly heightened scrutiny from both U.S. and foreign governments with respect to our compliance with laws and \\nregulations. Many of these laws and regulations are evolving and their applicability and scope, as interpreted by the \\ncourts, remain uncertain. Particularly with regard to AI; climate change and sustainability; competition; consumer \\nprotection; content moderation; data privacy and security; news publications; and reporting on human capital and \\ndiversity, we have seen an increase in new and evolving laws and regulations, as well as related enforcement actions \\nand investigations, being proposed and implemented in recent years by legislative and regulatory bodies around the \\nworld.\\nOur compliance with these laws and regulations may be onerous and could, individually or in the aggregate, \\nincrease our cost of doing business, make our products and services less useful, limit our ability to pursue certain \\nbusiness models, cause us to change our business practices, affect our competitive position relative to our peers, and/\\nor otherwise harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results.\\nFor additional information about government regulation applicable to our business, see Item 1A Risk Factors; \\nTrends in Our Business and Financial Effect in Part II, Item 7; and Legal Matters in Note 10 of the Notes to \\nConsolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\\nIntellectual Property\\nWe rely on various intellectual property laws, confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our \\nproprietary technology and our brand. We have registered, and applied for the registration of, U.S. and international \\ntrademarks, service marks, domain names, and copyrights. We have also filed patent applications in the U.S. and \\nforeign countries covering certain of our technology, and acquired patent assets to supplement our portfolio. We have \\nlicensed in the past, and expect that we may license in the future, certain of our rights to other parties.

Reduced spending by advertisers, a \\nloss of partners, or new and existing technologies that block ads online and/or affect our ability to customize \\nads could harm our business. \\nWe generated more than 75% of total revenues from online advertising in 2023. Many of our advertisers, \\ncompanies that distribute our products and services, digital publishers, and content providers can terminate their \\ncontracts with us at any time. These partners may not continue to do business with us if we do not create more value \\n(such as increased numbers of users or customers, new sales leads, increased brand awareness, or more effective \\nmonetization) than their available alternatives. Changes to our advertising policies and data privacy practices, such as \\nour initiatives to phase out third-party cookies, as well as changes to other companies’ advertising and/or data privacy \\npractices have in the past, and may in the future, affect the advertising that we are able to provide. In addition, \\ntechnologies have been developed that make customized ads more difficult, or that block the display of ads altogether, \\nand some providers of online services have integrated these technologies that could potentially impair the availability \\nand functionality of third-party digital advertising. Failing to provide superior value or deliver advertisements effectively \\nand competitively could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results. \\nIn addition, expenditures by advertisers tend to correlate with overall economic conditions. Adverse \\nmacroeconomic conditions have affected, and may in the future affect, the demand for advertising, resulting in \\nfluctuations in the amounts our advertisers spend on advertising, which could harm our financial condition and \\noperating results. \\nWe face intense competition. If we do not continue to innovate and provide products and services that \\nare useful to users, customers, and other partners, we may not remain competitive, which could harm our \\nbusiness, financial condition, and operating results. \\nOur business environment is rapidly evolving and intensely competitive. Our businesses face changing \\ntechnologies, shifting user needs, and frequent introductions of rival products and services. To compete successfully, \\nwe must accurately anticipate technology developments and deliver innovative, relevant and useful products, services, \\nand technologies in a timely manner. As our businesses evolve, the competitive pressure to innovate will encompass a \\nwider range of products and services. We must continue to invest significant resources in technical infrastructure and \\nR&D, including through acquisitions, in order to enhance our technology, products, and services. \\nWe have many competitors in different industries. Our current and potential domestic and international \\ncompetitors range from large and established companies to emerging start-ups. Some competitors have longer \\noperating histories and well-established relationships in various sectors. They can use their experience and resources \\nin ways that could affect our competitive position, including by making acquisitions and entering into other strategic \\narrangements; continuing to invest heavily in technical infrastructure, R&D, and in talent; initiating intellectual property \\nand competition claims (whether or not meritorious); and continuing to compete for users, advertisers, customers, and \\ncontent providers. Further, discrepancies in enforcement of existing laws may enable our lesser known competitors to \\naggressively interpret those laws without commensurate scrutiny, thereby affording them competitive advantages. Our \\ncompetitors may also be able to innovate and provide products and services faster than we can or may foresee the \\nneed for products and services before we do. \\nWe are expanding our investment in AI across the entire company. This includes generative AI and continuing to \\nintegrate AI capabilities into our products and services. AI technology and services are highly competitive, rapidly \\nevolving, and require significant investment, including development and operational costs, to meet the changing needs \\nand expectations of our existing users and attract new users. Our ability to deploy certain AI technologies critical for \\nour products and services and for our business strategy may depend on the availability and pricing of third-party \\nequipment and technical infrastructure. Additionally, other companies may develop AI products and technologies that \\nare similar or superior to our technologies or more cost-effective to deploy. Other companies may also have (or in the \\nfuture may obtain) patents or other proprietary rights that would prevent, limit, or interfere with our ability to make, use, \\nor sell our own AI products and services.\\nOur financial condition and operating results may also suffer if our products and services are not responsive to the \\nevolving needs and desires of our users, advertisers, publishers, customers, and content providers. As new and \\nexisting technologies continue to develop, competitors and new entrants may be able to offer experiences that are, or \\nTable of Contents\\nAlphabet Inc.\\n11.  \\nthat are seen to be, substantially similar to or better than ours. These technologies could reduce usage of our products \\nand services, and force us to compete in different ways and expend significant resources to develop and operate equal \\nor better products and services. Competitors’ success in providing compelling products and services or in attracting \\nand retaining users, advertisers, publishers, customers, and content providers could harm our financial condition and \\noperating results. \\nOur ongoing investment in new businesses, products, services, and technologies is inherently risky, and \\ncould divert management attention and harm our business, financial condition, and operating results. \\nWe have invested and expect to continue to invest in new businesses, products, services, and technologies in a \\nwide range of industries beyond online advertising. The investments that we are making across our businesses, such \\nas building AI capabilities into new and existing products and services, reflect our ongoing efforts to innovate and \\nprovide products and services that are helpful to users, advertisers, publishers, customers, and content providers. Our \\ninvestments ultimately may not be commercially viable or may not result in an adequate return of capital and, in \\npursuing new strategies, we may incur unanticipated liabilities. Innovations in our products and services could also \\nresult in changes to user behavior and affect our revenue trends. These endeavors involve significant risks and \\nuncertainties, including diversion of resources and management attention from current operations, different \\nmonetization models, and the use of alternative investment, governance, or compensation structures that may fail to \\nadequately align incentives across the company or otherwise accomplish their objectives.\\nWithin Google Services, we continue to invest heavily in devices, including our smartphones, home devices, and \\nwearables, which is a highly competitive market with frequent introduction of new products and services, rapid \\nadoption of technological advancements by competitors, increased market saturation in developed countries, short \\nproduct life cycles, evolving industry standards, continual improvement in performance characteristics, and price and \\nfeature sensitivity on the part of consumers and businesses. There can be no assurance we will be able to provide \\ndevices that compete effectively. \\nWithin Google Cloud, we devote significant resources to develop and deploy our enterprise-ready cloud services, \\nincluding Google Cloud Platform and Google Workspace, and we are advancing our AI platforms and models to \\nsupport these tools and technologies. We are incurring costs to build and maintain infrastructure to support cloud \\ncomputing services, invest in cybersecurity, and hire talent, particularly to support and scale our sales force. At the \\nsame time, our competitors are rapidly developing and deploying cloud-based services. Pricing and delivery models \\nare competitive and constantly evolving, and we may not attain sufficient scale and profitability to achieve our business \\nobjectives. Further, our business with public sector customers may present additional risks, including regulatory \\ncompliance risks. For instance, we may be subject to government audits and cost reviews, and any failure to comply or \\nany deficiencies found may expose us to legal, financial, and/or reputational risks. Evolving laws and regulations may \\nrequire us to make new capital investments, build new products, and seek partners to deliver localized services in \\nother countries, and we may not be able to meet sovereign operating requirements. \\nWithin Other Bets, we are investing significantly in the areas of health, life sciences, and transportation, among \\nothers. These investment areas face intense competition from large, experienced, and well-funded competitors, and \\nour offerings, many of which involve the development of new and emerging technologies, may not be successful, or be \\nable to compete effectively or operate at sufficient levels of profitability. \\nIn addition, new and evolving products and services, including those that use AI, raise ethical, technological, \\nlegal, regulatory, and other challenges, which may negatively affect our brands and demand for our products and \\nservices. Because all of these investment areas are inherently risky, no assurance can be given that such strategies \\nand offerings will be successful or will not harm our reputation, financial condition, and operating results. \\nOur revenue growth rate could decline over time, and we may experience downward pressure on our \\noperating margin in the future. \\nOur revenue growth rate could decline over time as a result of a number of factors, including changes in the \\ndevices and modalities used to access our products and services; changes in geographic mix; deceleration or declines \\nin advertiser spending; competition; customer usage and demand for our products; decreases in our pricing of our \\nproducts and services; ongoing product and policy changes; and shifts to lower priced products and services. \\nIn addition, we may experience downward pressure on our operating margin resulting from a variety of factors, \\nsuch as an increase in the mix of lower-margin products and services, in particular from the continued expansion of our \\nbusiness into new fields, including products and services such as our devices, Google Cloud, and consumer \\nsubscription products, as well as significant investments in Other Bets, all of which may have margins lower than those \\nwe generate from advertising. In particular, margins on our devices have had, and may continue to have, an adverse \\neffect on our consolidated margins due to pressures on pricing and higher cost of sales. We may also experience \\nTable of Contents\\nAlphabet Inc.\\n12.  \\ndownward pressure on our operating margins from increasing regulations, increasing competition, and increasing costs \\nfor many aspects of our business. Further, certain of our costs and expenses are generally less variable in nature and \\nmay not correlate to changes in revenue. We may also not be able to execute our efforts to re-engineer our cost base \\nsuccessfully or in a timely manner. Due to these factors and the evolving nature of our business, our historical revenue \\ngrowth rate and historical operating margin may not be indicative of our future performance. For additional information, \\nsee Trends in Our Business and Financial Effect and Revenues and Monetization Metrics in Part II, Item 7 of this \\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K. \\nOur intellectual property rights are valuable, and any inability to protect them could reduce the value of \\nour products, services, and brands as well as affect our ability to compete. \\nOur patents, trademarks, trade secrets, copyrights, and other intellectual property rights are important assets for \\nus. Various events outside of our control pose a threat to our intellectual property rights, as well as to our products, \\nservices, and technologies. For example, effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country \\nin which our products and services are distributed or made available through the Internet. Also, the efforts we have \\ntaken to protect our proprietary rights may not be sufficient or effective. Although we seek to obtain patent protection \\nfor our innovations, it is possible we may not be able to protect some of these innovations. Moreover, we may not have \\nadequate patent or copyright protection for certain innovations that later turn out to be important. There is always the \\npossibility that the scope of the protection gained will be insufficient or that an issued patent may be deemed invalid or \\nunenforceable. \\nWe also seek to maintain certain intellectual property as trade secrets. The secrecy of such trade secrets and \\nother sensitive information could be compromised, which could cause us to lose the competitive advantage resulting \\nfrom these trade secrets. We also face risks associated with our trademarks. For example, there is a risk that the word \\n“Google” could become so commonly used that it becomes synonymous with the word “search.” Some courts have \\nruled that \"Google\" is a protectable trademark, but it is possible that other courts, particularly those outside of the U.S., \\nmay reach a different determination. If this happens, we could lose protection for this trademark, which could result in \\nother people using the word “Google” to refer to their own products, thus diminishing our brand. \\nAny significant impairment of our intellectual property rights could harm our business and our ability to compete. \\nAlso, protecting our intellectual property rights is costly and time consuming. Any increase in the unauthorized use of \\nour intellectual property could make it more expensive to do business and harm our financial condition and operating \\nresults. \\nOur business depends on strong brands, and failing to maintain and enhance our brands would hurt our \\nability to expand our base of users, advertisers, customers, content providers, and other partners. \\nOur strong brands have significantly contributed to the success of our business. Maintaining and enhancing the \\nbrands within Google Services, Google Cloud, and Other Bets increases our ability to enter new categories and launch \\nnew and innovative products and services that better serve the needs of our users, advertisers, customers, content \\nproviders, and other partners. Our brands have been, and may in the future be, negatively affected by a number of \\nfactors, including, among others, reputational issues, third-party content shared on our platforms, data privacy and \\nsecurity issues and developments, and product or technical performance failures. For example, if we fail to respond \\nappropriately to the sharing of misinformation or objectionable content on our services and/or products or objectionable \\npractices by advertisers, or otherwise to adequately address user concerns, our users may lose confidence in our \\nbrands. \\nFurthermore, failure to maintain and enhance our brands could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, \\nand operating results. Our success will depend largely on our ability to remain a technology leader and continue to \\nprovide high-quality, trustworthy, innovative products and services that are truly useful and play a valuable role in a \\nrange of settings. \\nWe face a number of manufacturing and supply chain risks that could harm our business, financial \\ncondition, and operating results. \\nWe face a number of risks related to manufacturing and supply chain management, which could affect our ability \\nto supply both our products and our services. \\nWe rely on contract manufacturers to manufacture or assemble our devices and servers and networking \\nequipment used in our technical infrastructure, and we may supply the contract manufacturers with components to \\nassemble the devices and equipment. We also rely on other companies to participate in the supply of components and \\ndistribution of our products and services. Our business could be negatively affected if we are not able to engage these \\ncompanies with the necessary capabilities or capacity on reasonable terms, or if those we engage fail to meet their \\nTable of Contents\\nAlphabet Inc.\\n13.  \\nobligations (whether due to financial difficulties or other reasons), or make adverse changes in the pricing or other \\nmaterial terms of our arrangements with them. \\nWe have experienced and/or may in the future experience supply shortages, price increases, quality issues, and/\\nor longer lead times that could negatively affect our operations, driven by raw material, component availability, \\nmanufacturing capacity, labor shortages, industry allocations, logistics capacity, inflation, foreign currency exchange \\nrates, tariffs, sanctions and export controls, trade disputes and barriers, forced labor concerns, sustainability sourcing \\nrequirements, geopolitical tensions, armed conflicts, natural disasters or pandemics, the effects of climate change \\n(such as sea level rise, drought, flooding, heat waves, wildfires and resultant air quality effects and power shutdowns \\nassociated with wildfire prevention, and increased storm severity), power loss, and significant changes in the financial \\nor business condition of our suppliers. Some of the components we use in our technical infrastructure and our devices \\nare available from only one or limited sources, and we may not be able to find replacement vendors on favorable terms \\nin the event of a supply chain disruption. A significant supply interruption that affects us or our vendors could delay \\ncritical data center upgrades or expansions and delay consumer product availability. \\nWe may enter into long-term contracts for materials and products that commit us to significant terms and \\nconditions. We may face costs for materials and products that are not consumed due to market demand, technological \\nchange, changed consumer preferences, quality, product recalls, and warranty issues. For instance, because certain of \\nour hardware supply contracts have volume-based pricing or minimum purchase requirements, if the volume of sales \\nof our devices decreases or does not reach projected targets, we could face increased materials and manufacturing \\ncosts or other financial liabilities that could make our products more costly per unit to manufacture and harm our \\nfinancial condition and operating results. Furthermore, certain of our competitors may negotiate more favorable \\ncontractual terms based on volume and other commitments that may provide them with competitive advantages and \\nmay affect our supply. \\nOur devices have had, and in the future may have, quality issues resulting from design, manufacturing, or \\noperations. Sometimes, these issues may be caused by components we purchase from other manufacturers or \\nsuppliers. If the quality of our products and services does not meet expectations or our products or services are \\ndefective or require a recall, it could harm our reputation, financial condition, and operating results. \\nWe require our suppliers and business partners to comply with laws and, where applicable, our company policies \\nand practices, such as the Google Supplier Code of Conduct, regarding workplace and employment practices, data \\nsecurity, environmental compliance, and intellectual property licensing, but we do not control them or their practices. \\nViolations of law or unethical business practices could result in supply chain disruptions, canceled orders, harm to key \\nrelationships, and damage to our reputation. Their failure to procure necessary license rights to intellectual property \\ncould affect our ability to sell our products or services and expose us to litigation or financial claims. \\nInterruption to, interference with, or failure of our complex information technology and communications \\nsystems could hurt our ability to effectively provide our products and services, which could harm our \\nreputation, financial condition, and operating results. \\nThe availability of our products and services and fulfillment of our customer contracts depend on the continuing \\noperation of our information technology and communications systems. Our systems are vulnerable to damage, \\ninterference, or interruption from modifications or upgrades, terrorist attacks, state-sponsored attacks, natural disasters \\nor pandemics, geopolitical tensions or armed conflicts, export controls and sanctions, the effects of climate change \\n(such as sea level rise, drought, flooding, heat waves, wildfires and resultant air quality effects and power shutdowns \\nassociated with wildfire prevention, and increased storm severity), power loss, utility outages, telecommunications \\nfailures, computer viruses, software bugs, ransomware attacks, supply-chain attacks, computer denial of service \\nattacks, phishing schemes, or other attempts to harm or access our systems. Some of our data centers are located in \\nareas with a high risk of major earthquakes or other natural disasters. Our data centers are also subject to break-ins, \\nsabotage, and intentional acts of vandalism, and, in some cases, to potential disruptions resulting from problems \\nexperienced by facility operators or disruptions as a result of geopolitical tensions and conflicts happening in the area. \\nSome of our systems are not fully redundant, and disaster recovery planning cannot account for all eventualities. The \\noccurrence of a natural disaster or pandemic, closure of a facility, or other unanticipated problems affecting our data \\ncenters could result in lengthy interruptions in our service. In addition, our products and services are highly technical \\nand complex and have contained in the past, and may contain in the future, errors or vulnerabilities, which could result \\nin interruptions in or failure of our services or systems. Any of these incidents could impede or prevent us from \\neffectively offering products and providing services, which could harm our reputation, financial condition, and operating \\nresults. \\nOur international operations expose us to additional risks that could harm our business, financial \\ncondition, and operating results.\\nTable of Contents\\nAlphabet Inc.\\n14.  \\nOur international operations are significant to our revenues and net income, and we plan to continue to grow \\ninternationally. International revenues accounted for approximately 53% of our consolidated revenues in 2023. In \\naddition to risks described elsewhere in this section, our international operations expose us to other risks, including the \\nfollowing:\\n•\\nrestrictions on foreign ownership and investments, and stringent foreign exchange controls that might prevent \\nus from repatriating cash earned in countries outside the U.S.;\\n•\\nsanctions, import and export controls, other market access barriers, political unrest, geopolitical tensions, \\nchanges in regimes, or armed conflict (such as ongoing conflicts in the Middle East and Ukraine), any of which \\nmay affect our business continuity, increase our operating costs, limit demand for our products and services, \\nlimit our ability to source components or final products, or prevent or impede us from operating in certain \\njurisdictions, complying with local laws, or offering products or services;\\n•\\nlonger payment cycles in some countries, increased credit risk, and higher levels of payment fraud;\\n•\\nan evolving foreign policy landscape that may adversely affect our revenues and could subject us to litigation, \\nnew regulatory costs and challenges (including new customer requirements), uncertainty regarding regulatory \\noutcomes, and other liabilities under local laws that may not offer due process or clear legal precedent;\\n•\\nanti-corruption laws, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and other local laws prohibiting certain \\npayments to government officials, violations of which could result in civil and criminal penalties; and\\n•\\ndifferent employee/employer relationships, existence of works councils and differing labor practices, and other \\nchallenges caused by distance, language, local expertise, and cultural differences, increasing the complexity \\nof doing business in multiple jurisdictions.\\nBecause we conduct business in currencies other than U.S. dollars but report our financial results in U.S. dollars, \\nwe have faced, and will continue to face, exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Although we \\nhedge a portion of our international currency exposure, significant fluctuations in exchange rates between the U.S. \\ndollar and foreign currencies have in the past and may in the future adversely affect our revenues and earnings. \\nHedging programs are also inherently risky and could expose us to additional risks that could harm our financial \\ncondition and operating results. \\nWe are exposed to fluctuations in the fair values of our investments and, in some instances, our financial \\nstatements incorporate inherently subjective valuation methodologies. \\nThe fair value of our debt and equity investments may in the future be, and certain investments have been in the \\npast, negatively affected by liquidity, credit deterioration or losses, performance and financial results of the underlying \\nentities, foreign exchange rates, changes in interest rates, including changes that may result from the implementation \\nof new benchmark rates, the effect of new or changing regulations, the stock market in general, or other factors. \\nWe measure certain of our non-marketable equity and debt securities, certain other instruments including stock-\\nbased compensation awards settled in the stock of Other Bet companies, and certain assets and liabilities acquired in \\na business combination, at fair value on a nonrecurring basis, which is inherently subjective and requires management \\njudgment and estimation. All gains and losses on non-marketable equity securities are recognized in OI&E, which \\nincreases the volatility of our OI&E. The unrealized gains and losses or impairments we record from fair value \\nremeasurements in any particular period may differ significantly from the gains or losses we ultimately realize on such \\ninvestments.  \\nAs a result of these factors, the value of our investments could decline, which could harm our financial condition \\nand operating results. \\nRisks Related to our Industry \\nPeople access our products and services through a variety of platforms and devices that continue to \\nevolve with the advancement of technology and user preferences. If manufacturers and users do not widely \\nadopt versions of our products and services developed for these interfaces, our business could be harmed. \\nPeople access our products and services through a growing variety of devices such as desktop computers, \\nmobile phones, smartphones, laptops and tablets, video game consoles, voice-activated speakers, wearables \\n(including virtual reality and augmented reality devices), automobiles, and television-streaming devices. Our products \\nand services may be less popular on some interfaces. Each manufacturer or distributor may establish unique technical \\nstandards for its devices, and our products and services may not be available or may only be available with limited \\nfunctionality for our users or our advertisers on these devices as a result. Some manufacturers may also elect not to \\ninclude our products on their devices. In addition, search queries may be undertaken via voice-activated search, apps, \\nTable of Contents\\nAlphabet Inc.\\n15.  \\nsocial media or other platforms, which could harm our business. It is hard to predict the challenges we may encounter \\nin adapting our products and services and developing competitive new products and services. We expect to continue \\nto devote significant resources to creating and supporting products and services across multiple platforms and devices. \\nFailing to attract and retain a substantial number of new device manufacturers, suppliers, distributors, developers, and \\nusers, or failing to develop products and technologies that work well on new devices and platforms, could harm our \\nbusiness, financial condition, and operating results and ability to capture future business opportunities. \\nIssues in the development and use of AI may result in reputational harm and increased liability exposure. \\nOur evolving AI-related efforts may give rise to risks related to harmful content, inaccuracies, discrimination, \\nintellectual property infringement or misappropriation, defamation, data privacy, cybersecurity, and other issues. As a \\nresult of these and other challenges associated with innovative technologies, our implementation of AI systems could \\nsubject us to competitive harm, regulatory action, legal liability (including under new and proposed legislation and \\nregulations), new applications of existing data protection, privacy, intellectual property, and other laws, and brand or \\nreputational harm. \\nSome uses of AI will present ethical issues and may have broad effects on society. In order to implement AI \\nresponsibly and minimize unintended harmful effects, we have already devoted and will continue to invest significant \\nresources to develop, test, and maintain our products and services, but we may not be able to identify or resolve all AI-\\nrelated issues, deficiencies, and/or failures before they arise. Unintended consequences, uses, or customization of our \\nAI tools and systems may negatively affect human rights, privacy, employment, or other social concerns, which may \\nresult in claims, lawsuits, brand or reputational harm, and increased regulatory scrutiny, any of which could harm our \\nbusiness, financial condition, and operating results.\\nData privacy and security concerns relating to our technology and our practices could harm our \\nreputation, cause us to incur significant liability, and deter current and potential users or customers from \\nusing our products and services. Computer viruses, software bugs or defects, security breaches, and attacks \\non our systems could result in the improper disclosure and use of user data and interference with our users’ \\nand customers’ ability to use our products and services, harming our business and reputation. \\nConcerns about, including the adequacy of, our practices with regard to the collection, use, governance, \\ndisclosure, or security of personal data or other data-privacy-related matters, even if unfounded, could harm our \\nbusiness, reputation, financial condition, and operating results. Our policies and practices may change over time as \\nexpectations and regulations regarding privacy and data change. \\nOur products and services involve the storage, handling, and transmission of proprietary and other sensitive \\ninformation. Software bugs, theft, misuse, defects, vulnerabilities in our products and services, and security breaches \\nexpose us to a risk of loss or improper use and disclosure of such information, which could result in litigation and other \\npotential liabilities, including regulatory fines and penalties, as well as reputational harm. Additionally, our products \\nincorporate highly technical and complex technologies, and thus our technologies and software have contained, and \\nare likely in the future to contain, undetected errors, bugs, and/or vulnerabilities. We continue to add new features \\ninvolving AI to our offerings and internal systems, and features that rely on AI may be susceptible to unanticipated \\nsecurity threats as our and the market’s understanding of AI-centric security risks and protection methods continue to \\ndevelop. We have in the past discovered, and may in the future discover, some errors in our software code only after \\nwe have released the code. Systems and control failures, security breaches, failure to comply with our privacy policies, \\nand/or inadvertent disclosure of user data could result in government and legal exposure, seriously harm our \\nreputation, brand, and business, and impair our ability to attract and retain users or customers. Such incidents have \\noccurred in the past and may continue to occur due to the scale and nature of our products and services. While there \\nis no guarantee that such incidents will not cause significant damage, we expect to continue to expend significant \\nresources to maintain security protections that limit the effect of bugs, theft, misuse, and security vulnerabilities or \\nbreaches. \\nWe experience cyber attacks and other attempts to gain unauthorized access to our systems on a regular basis. \\nCyber attacks continue to evolve in sophistication and volume, and inherently may be difficult to detect for long periods \\nof time. We have seen, and will continue to see, industry-wide software supply chain vulnerabilities, which could affect \\nour or other parties’ systems. We expect to continue to experience such incidents or vulnerabilities in the future. Our \\nefforts to address undesirable activity on our platform may also increase the risk of retaliatory attack. In addition, we \\nface the risk of cyber attacks by nation-states and state-sponsored actors. These attacks may target us or our \\ncustomers, particularly our public sector customers (including federal, state, and local governments). Geopolitical \\ntensions or armed conflicts, such as the ongoing conflict in the Middle East and Ukraine, may increase these risks. \\nWe may experience security issues, whether due to employee or insider error or malfeasance, system errors, or \\nvulnerabilities in our or other parties’ systems. While we may not determine some of these issues to be material at the \\nTable of Contents\\nAlphabet Inc.\\n16.  \\ntime they occur and may remedy them quickly, there is no guarantee that these issues will not ultimately result in \\nsignificant legal, financial, and reputational harm, including government inquiries, enforcement actions, litigation, and \\nnegative publicity. There is also no guarantee that a series of related issues may not be determined to be material at a \\nlater date in the aggregate, even if they may not be material individually at the time of their occurrence. Because the \\ntechniques used to obtain unauthorized access to, disable or degrade service provided by or otherwise sabotage \\nsystems change frequently and often are recognized only after being launched against a target, even taking all \\nreasonable precautions, including those required by law, we have been unable in the past and may continue to be \\nunable to anticipate or detect attacks or vulnerabilities or implement adequate preventative measures. \\nFurther, if any partners with whom we share user or other customer information fail to implement adequate data-\\nsecurity practices, fail to comply with our terms and policies, or otherwise suffer a network or other security breach, our \\nusers’ data may be improperly accessed, used, or disclosed. If an actual or perceived breach of our or our business \\npartners’ or service providers’ security occurs, the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures \\nwould be harmed, we could lose users and customers, our trade secrets or those of our business partners may be \\ncompromised, and we may be exposed to significant legal and financial risks, including legal claims (which may \\ninclude class-action litigation) and regulatory actions, fines, and penalties. Any of the foregoing consequences could \\nharm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results. \\nWhile we have dedicated significant resources to privacy and security incident response capabilities, including \\ndedicated worldwide incident response teams, our response process, particularly during times of a natural disaster or \\npandemic, may not be adequate, may fail to accurately assess the severity of an incident, may not be fast enough to \\nprevent or limit harm, or may fail to sufficiently remediate an incident. As a result, we may suffer significant legal, \\nreputational, or financial exposure, which could harm our business, financial condition, and operating results. \\nFor additional information, see also our risk factor on privacy and data protection regulations under ‘Risks Related \\nto Laws, Regulations, and Policies’ below.\\nOur ongoing investments in safety, security, and content review will likely continue to identify abuse of \\nour platforms and misuse of user data. \\nIn addition to our efforts to prevent and mitigate cyber attacks, we are making significant investments in safety, \\nsecurity, and review efforts to combat misuse of our services and unauthorized access to user data by third parties, \\nincluding investigation and review of platform applications that could access the information of users of our services. \\nAs a result of these efforts, we have in the past discovered, and may in the future discover, incidents of unnecessary \\naccess to or misuse of user data or other undesirable activity by third parties. However, we may not have discovered, \\nand may in the future not discover, all such incidents or activity, whether as a result of our data limitations, including \\nour lack of visibility over our encrypted services, the scale of activity on our platform, or other factors, including factors \\noutside of our control such as a natural disaster or pandemic, and we may learn of such incidents or activity via third \\nparties. Such incidents and activities may include the use of user data or our systems in a manner inconsistent with our \\nterms, contracts or policies, the existence of false or undesirable user accounts, election interference, improper ad \\npurchases, activities that threaten people’s safety on- or off-line, or instances of spamming, scraping, or spreading \\ndisinformation. While we may not determine some of these incidents to be material at the time they occurred and we \\nmay remedy them quickly, there is no guarantee that these issues will not ultimately result in significant legal, financial, \\nand reputational harm, including government inquiries and enforcement actions, litigation, and negative publicity. There \\nis also no guarantee that a series of related issues may not be determined to be material at a later date in the \\naggregate, even if they may not be material individually at the time of their occurrence. \\nWe may also be unsuccessful in our efforts to enforce our policies or otherwise prevent or remediate any such \\nincidents. Any of the foregoing developments may negatively affect user trust and engagement, harm our reputation \\nand brands, require us to change our business practices in ways that harm our business operations, and adversely \\naffect our business and financial results. Any such developments may also subject us to additional litigation and \\nregulatory inquiries, which could result in monetary penalties and damages, divert management’s time and attention, \\nand lead to enhanced regulatory oversight. \\nProblematic content on our platforms, including low-quality user-generated content, web spam, content \\nfarms, and other violations of our guidelines could affect the quality of our services, which could harm our \\nreputation and deter our current and potential users from using our products and services. \\nWe, like others in the industry, face violations of our content guidelines across our platforms, including \\nsophisticated attempts by bad actors to manipulate our hosting and advertising systems to fraudulently generate \\nrevenues, or to otherwise generate traffic that does not represent genuine user interest or intent. While we invest \\nsignificantly in efforts to promote high-quality and relevant results and to detect and prevent low-quality content and \\ninvalid traffic, we have been unable and may continue to be unable to detect and prevent all such abuses or promote \\nTable of Contents\\nAlphabet Inc.\\n17.  \\nuniformly high-quality content. Increased use of AI in our offerings and internal systems may create new avenues of \\nabuse for bad actors.\\nMany websites violate or attempt to violate our guidelines, including by seeking to inappropriately rank higher in \\nsearch results than our search engine\\'s assessment of their relevance and utility would rank them. Such efforts have \\naffected, and may continue to affect, the quality of content on our platforms and lead them to display false, misleading, \\nor undesirable content. Although English-language web spam in our search results has been reduced, and web spam \\nin most other languages is limited, we expect web spammers will continue to seek inappropriate ways to improve their \\nrankings. Although we continue to invest in and deploy proprietary technology to detect and prevent web spam on our \\nplatforms, there is no guarantee that our technology will always be successful, and our users may have negative \\nexperiences on our platforms if our technology fails to work as intended, which may affect our users\\' decisions in \\ncontinuing to use our platforms. We also face other challenges from low-quality and irrelevant content websites, \\nincluding content farms, which are websites that generate large quantities of low-quality content to help them improve \\ntheir search rankings. We are continually launching algorithmic changes designed to detect and prevent abuse from \\nlow-quality websites, but we may not always be successful. We also face other challenges on our platforms, including \\nviolations of our content guidelines involving incidents such as attempted election interference, activities that threaten \\nthe safety and/or well-being of our users on- or off-line, and the spreading of misinformation or disinformation. \\nIf we fail to either detect and prevent an increase in problematic content or effectively promote high-quality \\ncontent, it could hurt our reputation for delivering relevant information or reduce use of our platforms, harming our \\nfinancial condition and operating results. It may also subject us to litigation and regulatory actions, which could result in \\nmonetary penalties and damages and divert management’s time and attention. \\nOur business depends on continued and unimpeded access to the Internet by us and our users. Internet \\naccess providers may be able to restrict, block, degrade, or charge for access to certain of our products and \\nservices, which could lead to additional expenses and the loss of users and advertisers. \\nOur products and services depend on the ability of our users to access the Internet, and certain of our products \\nrequire significant bandwidth to work effectively. Currently, this access is provided by companies that have significant \\nmarket power in the broadband and internet access marketplace, including incumbent telephone companies, cable \\ncompanies, mobile communications companies, and government-owned service providers. Some of these providers \\nhave taken, or have stated that they may take, measures that could degrade, disrupt, or increase the cost of user \\naccess to certain of our products by restricting or prohibiting the use of their infrastructure to support or facilitate our \\nofferings, by charging increased fees to us or our users to provide our offerings, or by providing our competitors \\npreferential access. Some jurisdictions have adopted regulations prohibiting certain forms of discrimination by internet \\naccess providers; however, substantial uncertainty exists in the U.S. and elsewhere regarding such protections. For \\nexample, in 2018 the U.S. Federal Communications Commission repealed net neutrality rules, which could permit \\ninternet access providers to restrict, block, degrade, or charge for access to certain of our products and services. In \\naddition, in some jurisdictions, our products and services have been subject to government-initiated restrictions or \\nblockages. These could harm existing key relationships, including with our users, customers, advertisers, and/or \\ncontent providers, and impair our ability to attract new ones; harm our reputation; and increase costs, thereby \\nnegatively affecting our business. \\nRisks Related to Laws, Regulations, and Policies \\nWe are subject to a variety of new, existing, and changing laws and regulations worldwide that could \\nharm our business, and will likely be subject to an even broader scope of laws and regulations as we continue \\nto expand our business. \\nWe are subject to numerous U.S. and foreign laws and regulations covering a wide variety of subjects, and our \\nintroduction of new businesses, products, services, and technologies will likely continue to subject us to additional laws \\nand regulations. In recent years, governments around the world have proposed and adopted a large number of new \\nlaws and regulations relevant to the digital economy, particularly in the areas of data privacy and security, competition, \\nenvironmental, social and governance (ESG) requirements, AI, and online content. The costs of compliance with these \\nmeasures are high and are likely to increase in the future. \\nNew or changing laws and regulations, or new interpretations or applications of existing laws and regulations in a \\nmanner inconsistent with our practices, have resulted in, and may continue to result in, less useful products and \\nservices, altered business practices, limited ability to pursue certain business models or offer certain products and \\nservices, substantial costs, and civil or criminal liability. Examples include laws and regulations regarding: \\n•\\nCompetition and technology platforms’ business practices: Laws and regulations focused on large \\ntechnology platforms, including the Digital Markets Act in the European Union (EU); regulations and legal \\nTable of Contents\\nAlphabet Inc.\\n18.  \\nsettlements in the U.S., South Korea, and elsewhere that affect Google Play’s billing policies, fees, and \\nbusiness model; as well as litigation and new regulations under consideration in a range of jurisdictions.\\n•\\nAI: Laws and regulations focused on the development, use, and provision of AI technologies and other digital \\nproducts and services, which could result in monetary penalties or other regulatory actions. For example, while \\nlegislative text has yet to be finalized and formally approved, provisional political agreement on a proposed EU \\nAI Act was reached between co-legislators in December 2023, including that specific transparency and other \\nrequirements would be introduced for general purpose AI systems and the models on which those systems are \\nbased. In addition, the White House\\'s Executive Order on the Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Development and \\nUse of Artificial Intelligence devises a framework for the U.S. government, among other things, to regulate \\nprivate sector use and development of certain foundation models. \\n•\\nData privacy, collection, and processing: Laws and regulations further restricting the collection, processing, \\nand/or sharing of user or advertising-related data, including privacy and data protection laws; laws affecting the \\nprocessing of children\\'s data (as discussed further below), data breach notification laws, and laws limiting data \\ntransfers (including data localization laws). \\n•\\nCopyright and other intellectual property: Copyright and related laws, including the EU Directive on \\nCopyright in the Digital Single Market and European Economic Area transpositions, which may introduce new \\nlicensing regimes, increase liability with respect to content uploaded by users or linked to from our platforms, \\nor create property rights in news publications that could require payments to news agencies and publishers, \\nwhich may result in other regulatory actions. \\n•\\nContent moderation: Various laws covering content moderation and removal, and related disclosure \\nobligations, such as the EU\\'s Digital Services Act, Florida’s Senate Bill 7072 and Texas’ House Bill 20, and \\nlaws and proposed legislation in Singapore, Australia, and the United Kingdom that impose penalties for failure \\nto remove certain types of content or require disclosure of information about the operation of our services and \\nalgorithms, which may make it harder for services like Google Search and YouTube to detect and deal with \\nlow-quality, deceptive, or harmful content.\\n•\\nConsumer protection: Consumer protection laws, including the EU’s New Deal for Consumers, which could \\nresult in monetary penalties and create a range of new compliance obligations.\\nIn addition, the applicability and scope of these and other laws and regulations, as interpreted by courts, \\nregulators, or administrative bodies, remain uncertain and could be interpreted in ways that harm our business. For \\nexample, we rely on statutory safe harbors, like those set forth in the Digital Millennium Copyright Act and Section 230 \\nof the Communications Decency Act in the U.S. and the E-Commerce Directive in Europe, to protect against liability for \\nvarious linking, caching, ranking, recommending, and hosting activities. Legislation or court rulings affecting these safe \\nharbors may adversely affect us and may impose significant operational challenges. There are legislative proposals \\nand pending litigation in the U.S., EU, and around the world that could diminish or eliminate safe harbor protection for \\nwebsites and online platforms. Our development, use, and commercialization of AI products and services (including \\nour implementation of AI in our offerings and internal systems) could subject us to regulatory action and legal liability, \\nincluding under specific legislation regulating AI, as well as new applications of existing data protection, cybersecurity, \\nprivacy, intellectual property, and other laws.\\nWe are and may continue to be subject to claims, lawsuits, regulatory and government investigations, \\nenforcement actions, consent orders, and other forms of regulatory scrutiny and legal liability that could harm \\nour business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results.\\nWe are subject to claims, lawsuits, regulatory and government investigations, other proceedings, and orders \\ninvolving competition, intellectual property, data privacy and security, tax and related compliance, labor and \\nemployment, commercial disputes, content generated by our users, goods and services offered by advertisers or \\npublishers using our platforms, personal injury, and other matters. We are also subject to a variety of claims including \\nproduct warranty, product liability, and consumer protection claims related to product defects, among other litigation, \\nand we may also be subject to claims involving health and safety, hazardous materials usage, other environmental \\neffects, AI training, development, and commercialization, or service disruptions or failures. Claims have been brought, \\nand we expect will continue to be brought, against us for defamation, negligence, breaches of contract, copyright and \\ntrademark infringement, unfair competition, unlawful activity, torts, privacy rights violations, fraud, or other legal \\ntheories based on the nature and content of information available on or via our services, the design and effect of our \\nproducts and services, or due to our involvement in hosting, transmitting, marketing, branding, or providing access to \\ncontent created by third parties. \\nTable of Contents\\nAlphabet Inc.\\n19.  \\nFor example, in December 2023, a California jury delivered a verdict in Epic Games v. Google finding that Google \\nviolated antitrust laws related to Google Play\\'s billing practices. The presiding judge will determine remedies in 2024 \\nand the range of potential remedies vary widely. We plan to appeal. In addition, the U.S. Department of Justice, \\nvarious U.S. states, and other plaintiffs have filed several antitrust lawsuits about various aspects of our business, \\nincluding our advertising technologies and practices, the operation and distribution of Google Search, and the \\noperation and distribution of the Android operating system and Play Store. Other regulatory agencies in the U.S. and \\naround the world, including competition enforcers, consumer protection agencies, and data protection authorities, have \\nchallenged and may continue to challenge our business practices and compliance with laws and regulations. We are \\ncooperating with these investigations and defending litigation or appealing decisions where appropriate. \\nVarious laws, regulations, investigations, enforcement lawsuits, and regulatory actions have involved in the past, \\nand may in the future result in substantial fines and penalties, injunctive relief, ongoing monitoring and auditing \\nobligations, changes to our products and services, alterations to our business models and operations, including \\ndivestiture, and collateral related civil litigation or other adverse consequences, all of which could harm our business, \\nreputation, financial condition, and operating results. \\nAny of these legal proceedings could result in legal costs, diversion of management resources, negative publicity \\nand other harms to our business. Estimating liabilities for our pending proceedings is a complex, fact-specific, and \\nspeculative process that requires significant judgment, and the amounts we are ultimately liable for may be less than or \\nexceed our estimates. The resolution of one or more such proceedings has resulted in, and may in the future result in, \\nadditional substantial fines, penalties, injunctions, and other sanctions that could harm our business, reputation, \\nfinancial condition, and operating results. \\nFor additional information about the ongoing material legal proceedings to which we are subject, see Legal \\nProceedings in Part I, Item 3 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\\nPrivacy, data protection, and data usage regulations are complex and rapidly evolving areas. Any failure \\nor alleged failure to comply with these laws could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and \\noperating results. \\nAuthorities around the world have adopted and are considering a number of legislative and regulatory proposals \\nconcerning data protection, data usage, and encryption of user data. Adverse legal rulings, legislation, or regulation \\nhave resulted in, and may continue to result in, fines and orders requiring that we change our practices, which have \\nhad and could continue to have an adverse effect on how we provide services, harming our business, reputation, \\nfinancial condition, and operating results. These laws and regulations are evolving and subject to interpretation, and \\ncompliance obligations could cause us to incur substantial costs or harm the quality and operations of our products \\nand services in ways that harm our business. Examples of these laws include: \\n•\\nThe General Data Protection Regulation and the United Kingdom General Data Protection Regulations, which \\napply to all of our activities conducted from an establishment in the EU or the United Kingdom, respectively, or \\nrelated to products and services that we offer to EU or the United Kingdom users or customers, respectively, or \\nthe monitoring of their behavior in the EU or the UK, respectively.\\n•\\nVarious comprehensive U.S. state and foreign privacy laws, which give new data privacy rights to their \\nrespective residents (including, in California, a private right of action in the event of a data breach resulting \\nfrom our failure to implement and maintain reasonable security procedures and practices) and impose \\nsignificant obligations on controllers and processors of consumer data.\\n•\\nState laws governing the processing of biometric information, such as the Illinois Biometric Information Privacy \\nAct and the Texas Capture or Use of Biometric Identifier Act, which impose obligations on businesses that \\ncollect or disclose consumer biometric information. \\n•\\nVarious federal, state, and foreign laws governing how companies provide age appropriate experiences to \\nchildren and minors, including the collection and processing of children and minor’s data. These include the \\nChildren’s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998, and the United Kingdom Age-Appropriate Design Code, all of \\nwhich address the use and disclosure of the personal data of children and minors and impose obligations on \\nonline services or products directed to or likely to be accessed by children. \\n•\\nThe California Internet of Things Security Law, which regulates the security of data used in connection with \\ninternet-connected devices.\\n•\\nThe EU’s Digital Markets Act, which will require in-scope companies to obtain user consent for combining data \\nacross certain products and require search engines to share anonymized data with rival companies, among \\nother changes. \\nTable of Contents\\nAlphabet Inc.\\n20.  \\nFurther, we are subject to evolving laws and regulations that dictate whether, how, and under what circumstances \\nwe can transfer, process and/or receive personal data, as well as ongoing enforcement actions from supervisory \\nauthorities related to cross-border transfers of personal data. The validity of various data transfer mechanisms we \\ncurrently rely upon remains subject to legal, regulatory, and political developments in both Europe and the U.S., which \\nmay require us to adapt our existing arrangements.\\nWe face, and may continue to face, intellectual property and other claims that could be costly to defend, \\nresult in significant damage awards or other costs (including indemnification awards), and limit our ability to \\nuse certain technologies. \\nWe, like other internet, technology, and media companies, are frequently subject to litigation based on allegations \\nof infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights, including patent, copyright, trade secrets, and \\ntrademarks. Parties have also sought broad injunctive relief against us by filing claims in U.S. and international courts \\nand the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) for exclusion and cease-and-desist orders. In addition, patent-\\nholding companies may frequently seek to generate income from patents they have obtained by bringing claims \\nagainst us. As we continue to expand our business, the number of intellectual property claims against us has increased \\nand may continue to increase as we develop and acquire new products, services, and technologies. \\nAdverse results in any of these lawsuits may include awards of monetary damages, costly royalty or licensing \\nagreements (if licenses are available at all), or orders limiting our ability to sell our products and services in the U.S. or \\nelsewhere, including by preventing us from offering certain features, functionalities, products, or services in certain \\njurisdictions. They may also cause us to change our business practices in ways that could result in a loss of revenues \\nfor us and otherwise harm our business. \\nMany of our agreements with our customers and partners, including certain suppliers, require us to defend \\nagainst certain intellectual property infringement claims and in some cases indemnify them for certain intellectual \\nproperty infringement claims against them, which could result in increased costs for defending such claims or \\nsignificant damages if there were an adverse ruling in any such claims. Such customers and partners may also \\ndiscontinue the use of our products, services, and technologies, as a result of injunctions or otherwise, which could \\nresult in loss of revenues and harm our business. Moreover, intellectual property indemnities provided to us by our \\nsuppliers, when obtainable, may not cover all damages and losses suffered by us and our customers arising from \\nintellectual property infringement claims. Furthermore, in connection with our divestitures, we have agreed, and may in \\nthe future agree, to provide indemnification for certain potential liabilities, including those associated with intellectual \\nproperty claims. Regardless of their merits, intellectual property claims are often time consuming and expensive to \\nlitigate or settle. To the extent such claims are successful, they could harm our business, including our product and \\nservice offerings, financial condition, and operating results. \\nExpectations relating to ESG considerations could expose us to potential liabilities, increased costs, and \\nreputational harm. \\nWe are subject to laws, regulations, and other measures that govern a wide range of topics, including those \\nrelated to matters beyond our core products and services. For instance, new laws, regulations, policies, and \\ninternational accords relating to ESG matters, including sustainability, climate change, human capital, and diversity, are \\nbeing developed and formalized in Europe, the U.S., and elsewhere, which may entail specific, target-driven \\nframeworks and/or disclosure requirements. We have implemented robust ESG programs, adopted reporting \\nframeworks and principles, and announced a number of goals and initiatives. The implementation of these goals and \\ninitiatives may require considerable investments, and our goals, with all of their contingencies, dependencies, and in \\ncertain cases, reliance on third-party verification and/or performance, are complex and ambitious, and may change. \\nWe cannot guarantee that our goals and initiatives will be fully realized on the timelines we expect or at all, and \\nprojects that are completed as planned may not achieve the results we anticipate. Any failure, or perceived failure, by \\nus to adhere to our public statements, comply fully with developing interpretations of ESG laws and regulations, or \\nmeet evolving and varied stakeholder expectations and standards could harm our business, reputation, financial \\ncondition, and operating results.\\nWe could be subject to changes in tax rates, the adoption of new U.S. or international tax legislation, or \\nexposure to additional tax liabilities. \\nWe are subject to a variety of taxes and tax collection obligations in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. \\nOur effective tax rates are affected by a variety of factors, including changes in the mix of earnings in jurisdictions with \\ndifferent statutory tax rates, net gains and losses on hedges and related transactions under our foreign exchange risk \\nmanagement program, changes in our stock price for shares issued as employee compensation, changes in the \\nvaluation of our deferred tax assets or liabilities, and the application of different provisions of tax laws or changes in tax \\nlaws, regulations, or accounting principles (including changes in the interpretation of existing laws). Further, if we are \\nTable of Contents\\nAlphabet Inc.\\n21.  \\nunable or fail to collect taxes on behalf of customers, employees and partners as the withholding agent, we could \\nbecome liable for taxes that are levied against third parties. \\nWe are subject to regular review and audit by both domestic and foreign tax authorities. As a result, we have \\nreceived, and may in the future receive, assessments in multiple jurisdictions, on various tax-related assertions, such \\nas transfer-pricing adjustments or permanent-establishment claims. Any adverse outcome of such a review or audit \\ncould harm our financial condition and operating results, require adverse changes to our business practices, or subject \\nus to additional litigation and regulatory inquiries. In addition, the determination of our worldwide provision for income \\ntaxes and other tax liabilities requires significant judgment and often involves uncertainty. Although we believe our \\nestimates are reasonable, the ultimate tax outcome may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements \\nand may affect our financial results in the period or periods for which such determination is made. \\nFurthermore, due to shifting economic and political conditions, tax policies, laws, or rates in various jurisdictions \\nmay be subject to significant changes in ways that could harm our financial condition and operating results. For \\nexample, various jurisdictions around the world have enacted or are considering revenue-based taxes such as digital \\nservices taxes and other targeted taxes, which could lead to inconsistent and potentially overlapping international tax \\nregimes. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) is coordinating negotiations among \\nmore than 140 countries with the goal of achieving consensus around substantial changes to international tax policies, \\nincluding the implementation of a minimum global effective tax rate of 15%. Our effective tax rate and cash tax \\npayments could increase in future years as a result of these changes.\\nRisks Related to Ownership of our Stock \\nWe cannot guarantee that any share repurchase program will be fully consummated or will enhance long-\\nterm stockholder value, and share repurchases could increase the volatility of our stock prices and could \\ndiminish our cash reserves. \\nWe engage in share repurchases of our Class A and Class C stock from time to time in accordance with \\nauthorizations from the Board of Directors of Alphabet. Our repurchase program does not have an expiration date and \\ndoes not obligate Alphabet to repurchase any specific dollar amount or to acquire any specific number of shares. \\nFurther, our share repurchases could affect our share trading prices, increase their volatility, reduce our cash reserves \\nand may be suspended or terminated at any time, which may result in a decrease in the trading prices of our stock. \\nThe concentration of our stock ownership limits our stockholders’ ability to influence corporate matters. \\nOur Class B stock has 10 votes per share, our Class A stock has one vote per share, and our Class C stock has \\nno voting rights. As of December 31, 2023, Larry Page and Sergey Brin beneficially owned approximately 86.5% of our \\noutstanding Class B stock, which represented approximately 51.5% of the voting power of our outstanding common \\nstock. Through their stock ownership, Larry and Sergey have significant influence over all matters requiring \\nstockholder approval, including the election of directors and significant corporate transactions, such as a merger or \\nother sale of our company or our assets, for the foreseeable future. In addition, because our Class C stock carries no \\nvoting rights (except as required by applicable law), the issuance of the Class C stock, including in future stock-based \\nacquisition transactions and to fund employee equity incentive programs, could continue Larry and Sergey’s current \\nrelative voting power and their ability to elect all of our directors and to determine the outcome of most matters \\nsubmitted to a vote of our stockholders. The share repurchases made pursuant to our repurchase program may also \\naffect Larry and Sergey’s relative voting power. This concentrated control limits or severely restricts other stockholders’ \\nability to influence corporate matters and we may take actions that some of our stockholders do not view as beneficial, \\nwhich could reduce the market price of our Class A stock and our Class C stock. \\nProvisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could discourage a takeover that \\nstockholders may consider favorable. \\nProvisions in Alphabet’s certificate of incorporation and bylaws may have the effect of delaying or preventing a \\nchange of control or changes in our management. These provisions include the following: \\n•\\nOur Board of Directors has the right to elect directors to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of the Board of \\nDirectors or the resignation, death, or removal of a director.\\n•\\nOur stockholders may not act by written consent, which makes it difficult to take certain actions without holding \\na stockholders\\' meeting.\\n•\\nOur certificate of incorporation prohibits cumulative voting in the election of directors. This limits the ability of \\nminority stockholders to elect director candidates.\\nTable of Contents\\nAlphabet Inc.\\n22.  \\n•\\nStockholders must provide advance notice to nominate individuals for election to the Board of Directors or to \\npropose matters that can be acted upon at a stockholders’ meeting. These provisions may discourage or deter \\na potential acquirer from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect the acquirer\\'s own slate of directors or \\notherwise attempting to obtain control of our company. \\n•\\nOur Board of Directors may issue, without stockholder approval, shares of undesignated preferred stock, \\nwhich makes it possible for our Board of Directors to issue preferred stock with voting or other rights or \\npreferences that could impede the success of any attempt to acquire us. \\nAs a Delaware corporation, we are also subject to certain Delaware anti-takeover provisions. Under Delaware \\nlaw, a corporation may not engage in a business combination with any holder of 15% or more of its outstanding voting \\nstock unless the holder has held the stock for three years or, among other things, the Board of Directors has approved \\nthe transaction. Our Board of Directors could rely on Delaware law to prevent or delay an acquisition of us. \\nThe trading price for our Class A stock and non-voting Class C stock may continue to be volatile. \\nThe trading price of our stock has at times experienced significant volatility and may continue to be volatile. In \\naddition to the factors discussed in this report, the trading prices of our Class A stock and Class C stock have \\nfluctuated, and may continue to fluctuate widely, in response to various factors, many of which are beyond our control, \\nincluding, among others, the activities of our peers and changes in broader economic and political conditions around \\nthe world. These broad market and industry factors could harm the market price of our Class A stock and our Class C \\nstock, regardless of our actual operating performance. \\nGeneral Risks \\nOur operating results may fluctuate, which makes our results difficult to predict and could cause our \\nresults to fall short of expectations. \\nOur operating results have fluctuated, and may in the future fluctuate, as a result of a number of factors, many \\noutside of our control, including the cyclical nature and seasonality in our business and geopolitical events. As a result, \\ncomparing our operating results (including our expenses as a percentage of our revenues) on a period-to-period basis \\nmay not be meaningful, and our past results should not be relied on as an indication of our future performance. \\nConsequently, our operating results in future quarters may fall below expectations. \\nAcquisitions, joint ventures, investments, and divestitures could result in operating difficulties, dilution, \\nand other consequences that could harm our business, financial condition, and operating results. \\nAcquisitions, joint ventures, investments, and divestitures are important elements of our overall corporate strategy \\nand use of capital, and these transactions could be material to our financial condition and operating results. We expect \\nto continue to evaluate and enter into discussions regarding a wide array of such potential strategic arrangements, \\nwhich could create unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures. Some of the areas where we face risks include: \\n•\\ndiversion of management time and focus from operating our business to challenges related to acquisitions and \\nother strategic arrangements; \\n•\\nfailure to obtain required approvals on a timely basis, if at all, from governmental authorities, or conditions \\nplaced upon approval that could, among other things, delay or prevent us from completing a transaction, or \\notherwise restrict our ability to realize the expected financial or strategic goals of a transaction;\\n•\\nfailure to successfully integrate the acquired operations, technologies, services, and personnel (including \\ncultural integration and retention of employees) and further develop the acquired business or technology; \\n•\\nimplementation of controls (or remediation of control deficiencies), procedures, and policies at the acquired \\ncompany; \\n•\\nintegration of the acquired company’s accounting and other administrative systems, and the coordination of \\nproduct, engineering, and sales and marketing functions;\\n•\\ntransition of operations, users, and customers onto our existing platforms;\\n•\\nin the case of foreign acquisitions, the need to integrate operations across different cultures and languages \\nand to address the particular economic, currency, political, and regulatory risks associated with specific \\ncountries; \\n•\\nfailure to accomplish commercial, strategic or financial objectives with respect to investments, joint ventures, \\nand other strategic arrangements;\\n•\\nfailure to realize the value of investments and joint ventures due to a lack of liquidity;\\nTable of Contents\\nAlphabet Inc.\\n23.  \\n•\\nliability for activities of the acquired company before the acquisition, including patent and trademark \\ninfringement claims, data privacy and security issues, violations of laws, commercial disputes, tax liabilities, \\nwarranty claims, product liabilities, and other known and unknown liabilities; and\\n•\\nlitigation or other claims in connection with the acquired company, including claims from terminated \\nemployees, customers, former stockholders, or other third parties.\\nOur failure to address these risks or other problems encountered in connection with our past or future acquisitions \\nand other strategic arrangements could cause us to fail to realize their anticipated benefits, incur unanticipated \\nliabilities, and harm our business generally. \\nOur acquisitions and other strategic arrangements could also result in dilutive issuances of our equity securities, \\nthe incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities, or amortization expenses, or impairment of goodwill and/or purchased \\nlong-lived assets, and restructuring charges, any of which could harm our financial condition and operating results. \\nAlso, the anticipated benefits or value of our acquisitions and other strategic arrangements may not materialize. In \\nconnection with our divestitures, we have agreed, and may in the future agree, to provide indemnification for certain \\npotential liabilities, which could harm our financial condition and operating results. \\nWe rely on highly skilled personnel and, if we are unable to retain or motivate key personnel, hire \\nqualified personnel, or maintain and continue to adapt our corporate culture, we may not be able to grow or \\noperate effectively. \\nOur performance and future success depends in large part upon the continued service of key technical leads as \\nwell as members of our senior management team. For instance, Sundar Pichai is critical to the overall management of \\nAlphabet and its subsidiaries and plays an important role in the development of our technology, maintaining our \\nculture, and setting our strategic direction. \\nOur ability to compete effectively and our future success depend on our continuing to identify, hire, develop, \\nmotivate, and retain highly skilled personnel for all areas of our organization. Competition in our industry for qualified \\nemployees is intense, and certain of our competitors have directly targeted, and may continue to target, our \\nemployees. In addition, our compensation arrangements, such as our equity award programs, may not always be \\nsuccessful in attracting new employees and retaining and motivating our existing employees. Restrictive immigration \\npolicy and regulatory changes may also affect our ability to hire, mobilize, or retain some of our global talent. All of our \\nexecutive officers and key employees are at-will employees, and we do not maintain any key-person life insurance \\npolicies.\\nIn addition, we believe that our corporate culture fosters innovation, creativity, and teamwork. As our organization \\ngrows and evolves, we may need to adapt our corporate culture and work environments to ever-changing \\ncircumstances, such as during times of a natural disaster or pandemic, and these changes could affect our ability to \\ncompete effectively or have an adverse effect on our corporate culture. Under our hybrid work models, we may \\nexperience increased costs and/or disruption, in addition to potential effects on our ability to operate effectively and \\nmaintain our corporate culture. \\nITEM 1B.\\nUNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS\\nNot applicable.\\nITEM 1C.  CYBERSECURITY\\nWe maintain a comprehensive process for identifying, assessing, and managing material risks from cybersecurity \\nthreats as part of our broader risk management system and processes. We obtain input, as appropriate, for our \\ncybersecurity risk management program on the security industry and threat trends from multiple external experts and \\ninternal threat intelligence teams. Teams of dedicated privacy, safety, and security professionals oversee cybersecurity \\nrisk management and mitigation, incident prevention, detection, and remediation. Leadership for these teams are \\nprofessionals with deep cybersecurity expertise across multiple industries, including our Vice President of Privacy, \\nSafety, and Security Engineering. Our executive leadership team, along with input from the above teams, are \\nresponsible for our overall enterprise risk management system and processes and regularly consider cybersecurity \\nrisks in the context of other material risks to the company.\\nAs part of our cybersecurity risk management system, our incident management teams track and log privacy and \\nsecurity incidents across Alphabet, our vendors, and other third-party service providers to remediate and resolve any \\nsuch incidents. Significant incidents are reviewed regularly by a cross-functional working group to determine whether \\nfurther escalation is appropriate. Any incident assessed as potentially being or potentially becoming material is \\nimmediately escalated for further assessment, and then reported to designated members of our senior management. \\nWe consult with outside counsel as appropriate, including on materiality analysis and disclosure matters, and our \\nTable of Contents\\nAlphabet Inc.\\n24.  \\nsenior management makes the final materiality determinations and disclosure and other compliance decisions. Our \\nmanagement apprises Alphabet’s independent public accounting firm of matters and any relevant developments.\\nThe Audit and Compliance Committee has oversight responsibility for risks and incidents relating to cybersecurity \\nthreats, including compliance with disclosure requirements, cooperation with law enforcement, and related effects on \\nfinancial and other risks, and it reports any findings and recommendations, as appropriate, to the full Board for \\nconsideration. Senior management regularly discusses cyber risks and trends and, should they arise, any material \\nincidents with the Audit and Compliance Committee. Internal Audit maintains a dedicated cybersecurity auditing team \\nthat independently tests our cybersecurity controls. \\nOur business strategy, results of operations and financial condition have not been materially affected by risks from \\ncybersecurity threats, including as a result of previously identified cybersecurity incidents, but we cannot provide \\nassurance that they will not be materially affected in the future by such risks or any future material incidents. For more \\ninformation on our cybersecurity related risks, see Item 1A Risk Factors of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\\nITEM 2.\\nPROPERTIES\\nOur headquarters are located in Mountain View, California. We own and lease office facilities and data centers \\naround the world, primarily in Asia, Europe, and North America. We believe our existing facilities are in good condition \\nand suitable for the conduct of our business.\\nITEM 3.\\nLEGAL PROCEEDINGS\\nFor a description of our material pending legal proceedings, see Legal Matters in Note 10 of the Notes to \\nConsolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which is \\nincorporated herein by reference.\\nITEM 4.\\nMINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES\\nNot applicable.\\nPART II\\nITEM 5.\\nMARKET FOR REGISTRANT’S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS, AND \\nISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES\\nAs of October 2, 2015, Alphabet Inc. became the successor issuer of Google Inc. pursuant to Rule 12g-3(a) under \\nthe Exchange Act. Our Class A stock has been listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol “GOOG” \\nsince August 19, 2004, and under the symbol \"GOOGL\" since April 3, 2014. Prior to August 19, 2004, there was no \\npublic market for our stock. Our Class B stock is neither listed nor traded. Our Class C stock has been listed on the \\nNasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol “GOOG” since April 3, 2014.\\nHolders of Record\\nAs of December 31, 2023, there were approximately 7,305 and 1,757 stockholders of record of our Class A stock \\nand Class C stock, respectively. Because many of our shares of Class A stock and Class C stock are held by brokers \\nand other institutions on behalf of stockholders, we are unable to estimate the total number of stockholders \\nrepresented by these record holders. As of December 31, 2023, there were approximately 59 stockholders of record of \\nour Class B stock.\\nDividend Policy\\nWe have never declared or paid any cash dividend on our common or capital stock. The primary use of capital \\ncontinues to be to invest for the long-term growth of the business. We regularly evaluate our cash and capital structure, \\nincluding the size, pace, and form of capital return to stockholders.\\nTable of Contents\\nAlphabet Inc.\\n25.  \\nIssuer Purchases of Equity Securities\\nThe following table presents information with respect to Alphabet\\'s repurchases of Class A and Class C stock \\nduring the quarter ended December 31, 2023: \\nPeriod\\nTotal Number of \\nClass A Shares \\nPurchased \\n(in thousands)(1)\\nTotal Number of \\nClass C Shares \\nPurchased \\n(in thousands)(1)\\nAverage Price \\nPaid per \\nClass A \\nShare(2)\\nAverage Price \\nPaid per \\nClass C \\nShare(2)\\nTotal Number of \\nShares \\nPurchased as \\nPart of Publicly \\nAnnounced \\nPrograms\\n(in thousands)(1)\\nApproximate \\nDollar Value of \\nShares that May \\nYet Be Purchased \\nUnder the \\nProgram \\n(in millions)\\nOctober 1 - 31\\n \\n9,923  \\n38,687 $ \\n134.66 $ \\n135.65  \\n48,610 $ \\n45,736 \\nNovember 1 - 30\\n \\n9,197  \\n28,198 $ \\n134.53 $ \\n135.16  \\n37,395 $ \\n40,725 \\nDecember 1 - 31\\n \\n7,502  \\n24,760 $ \\n135.76 $ \\n136.37  \\n32,262 $ \\n36,347 \\nTotal\\n \\n26,622  \\n91,645 \\n \\n118,267 \\n(1) \\nRepurchases are being executed from time to time, subject to general business and market conditions and other investment \\nopportunities, through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions, including through Rule 10b5-1 plans.

Discussion of 2022 results \\ncompared to 2021 results to the extent not included in this report can be found in Item 7 of our 2022 Annual Report on \\nForm 10-K.\\nUnderstanding Alphabet’s Financial Results\\nAlphabet is a collection of businesses — the largest of which is Google. We report Google in two segments, \\nGoogle Services and Google Cloud; we also report all non-Google businesses collectively as Other Bets. For \\nadditional information on our segments, see Part I, Item 1 Business and Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated \\nFinancial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\\nTrends in Our Business and Financial Effect\\nThe following long-term trends have contributed to the results of our consolidated operations, and we anticipate \\nthat they will continue to affect our future results:\\n•\\nUsers\\' behaviors and advertising continue to shift online as the digital economy evolves.\\nThe continuing evolution of the online world has contributed to the growth of our business and our revenues since \\ninception. We expect that this evolution will continue to benefit our business and our revenues, although at a slower \\npace than we have experienced historically, in particular after the outsized growth in our advertising revenues during \\nthe COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, we face increasing competition for user engagement and advertisers, which may \\naffect our revenues.\\n•\\nUsers continue to access our products and services using diverse devices and modalities, which \\nallows for new advertising formats that may benefit our revenues but adversely affect our margins.\\nOur users are accessing our products and services via diverse devices and modalities, such as smartphones, \\nwearables, connected TVs, and smart home devices, and want to be able to be connected no matter where they are or \\nwhat they are doing. We are focused on expanding our products and services to stay in front of these trends in order to \\nmaintain and grow our business.\\nWe benefit from advertising revenues generated from different channels, including mobile, and newer advertising \\nformats. The margins from these channels and newer products have generally been lower than those from traditional \\ndesktop search. Additionally, as the market for a particular device type or modality matures, our advertising revenues \\nmay be affected. For example, changing dynamics within the global smartphone market, such as increased market \\nsaturation in developed countries, can affect our mobile advertising revenues.\\nWe expect TAC paid to our distribution partners and Google Network partners to increase as our revenues grow \\nand TAC as a percentage of our advertising revenues (\"TAC rate\") to be affected by changes in device mix; geographic \\nmix; partner agreement terms; partner mix; the percentage of queries channeled through paid access points; product \\nmix; the relative revenue growth rates of advertising revenues from different channels; and revenue share terms.\\nWe expect these trends to continue to affect our revenues and put pressure on our margins.\\n•\\nAs online advertising evolves, we continue to expand our product offerings, which may affect our \\nmonetization.\\nAs interactions between users and advertisers change, and as online user behavior evolves, we continue to \\nexpand our product offerings to serve these changing needs, which may affect our monetization. For example, \\nrevenues from ads on YouTube and Google Play monetize at a lower rate than our traditional search ads. We also \\nexpect to continue to incorporate AI innovations into our products, such as AI in Search, that could affect our \\nmonetization trends. When developing new products and services we generally focus first on user experience and then \\non monetization.\\n•\\nAs users in developing economies increasingly come online, our revenues from international markets \\ncontinue to increase, and may require continued investments. In addition, movements in foreign exchange \\nrates affect such revenues. \\nTable of Contents\\nAlphabet Inc.\\n29.  \\nThe shift to online, as well as the advent of the multi-device world, has brought opportunities outside of the U.S., \\nincluding in emerging markets, such as India. We continue to invest heavily and develop localized versions of our \\nproducts and advertising programs relevant to our users in these markets. This has led to a trend of increased \\nrevenues from emerging markets. We expect that our results will continue to be affected by our performance in these \\nmarkets, particularly as low-cost mobile devices become more available. This trend could affect our revenues as \\ndeveloping markets initially monetize at a lower rate than more mature markets.\\nInternational revenues represent a significant portion of our revenues and are subject to fluctuations in foreign \\ncurrency exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar. While we have a foreign exchange risk management program \\ndesigned to reduce our exposure to these fluctuations, this program does not fully offset their effect on our revenues \\nand earnings.\\n•\\nThe revenues that we derive beyond advertising are increasing and may adversely affect our margins.\\nRevenues from cloud, consumer subscriptions, platforms, and devices, which may have differing characteristics \\nthan our advertising revenues, have grown over time, and we expect this trend to continue as we focus on expanding \\nour products and services. The margins on these revenues vary significantly and are generally lower than the margins \\non our advertising revenues. For example, sales of our devices  adversely affect our consolidated margins due to \\npressures on pricing and higher cost of sales.\\n•\\nAs we continue to serve our users and expand our businesses, we will invest heavily in operating and \\ncapital expenditures.\\nWe continue to make significant research and development investments in areas of strategic focus as we seek to \\ndevelop new, innovative offerings, improve our existing offerings, and rapidly and responsibly deploy AI across our \\nbusinesses. We also expect to increase, relative to 2023, our investment in our technical infrastructure, including \\nservers, network equipment, and data centers, to support the growth of our business and our long-term initiatives, in \\nparticular in support of AI products and services. In addition, acquisitions and strategic investments contribute to the \\nbreadth and depth of our offerings, expand our expertise in engineering and other functional areas, and build strong \\npartnerships around strategic initiatives.\\n•\\nWe continue to face an evolving regulatory environment, and we are subject to claims, lawsuits, \\ninvestigations, and other forms of potential legal liability, which could affect our business practices and \\nfinancial results.\\nChanges in social, political, economic, tax, and regulatory conditions or in laws and policies governing a wide \\nrange of topics and related legal matters, including investigations, lawsuits, and regulatory actions, have resulted in \\nfines and caused us to change our business practices. As these global trends continue, our cost of doing business may \\nincrease, our ability to pursue certain business models or offer certain products or services may be limited, and we \\nmay need to change our business practices to comply with evolving regulatory and legal matters. Examples include the \\nantitrust complaints filed by the U.S. Department of Justice and a number of state Attorneys General; legislative \\nproposals and pending litigation in the U.S., EU, and around the world that could diminish or eliminate safe harbor \\nprotection for websites and online platforms; and the Digital Markets Act and Digital Services Act in Europe and various \\nlegislative proposals in the U.S. focused on large technology platforms.

Our operating expenses \\ninclude costs related to R&D, sales and marketing, and general and administrative functions. Certain of our costs and \\nexpenses, including those associated with the operation of our technical infrastructure as well as components of our \\noperating expenses, are generally less variable in nature and may not correlate to changes in revenue. Additionally, \\nfluctuations in compensation expenses may not directly correlate with changes in headcount, in particular due to \\nannual stock-based compensation (SBC) awards that generally vest over four years. \\nCost of Revenues\\nCost of revenues is comprised of TAC and other costs of revenues.\\n•\\nTAC includes: \\n◦\\namounts paid to our distribution partners who make available our search access points and services. \\nOur distribution partners include browser providers, mobile carriers, original equipment manufacturers, \\nand software developers; and\\n◦\\namounts paid to Google Network partners primarily for ads displayed on their properties.\\n•\\nOther cost of revenues primarily includes:\\n◦\\ncompensation expense related to our data centers and other operations such as content review and \\ncustomer and product support;\\n◦\\ncontent acquisition costs, which are payments to content providers from whom we license video and \\nother content for distribution on YouTube and Google Play (we pay fees to these content providers \\nbased on revenues generated or a flat fee);\\n◦\\ndepreciation expense related to our technical infrastructure; and\\n◦\\ninventory and other costs related to the devices we sell.\\nTable of Contents\\nAlphabet Inc.\\n32.  \\nTAC as a percentage of revenues generated from ads placed on Google Network properties are significantly \\nhigher than TAC as a percentage of revenues generated from ads placed on Google Search & other properties, \\nbecause most of the advertiser revenues from ads served on Google Network properties are paid as TAC to our \\nGoogle Network partners.\\nOperating Expenses\\nOperating expenses are generally incurred during our normal course of business, which we categorize as either \\nR&D, sales and marketing, or general and administrative.\\nThe main components of our R&D expenses are:\\n•\\ncompensation expenses for engineering and technical employees responsible for R&D related to our existing \\nand new products and services; \\n•\\ndepreciation; and\\n•\\nthird-party services fees primarily relating to consulting and outsourced services in support of our engineering \\nand product development efforts.\\nThe main components of our sales and marketing expenses are:\\n•\\ncompensation expenses for employees engaged in sales and marketing, sales support, and certain customer \\nservice functions; and\\n•\\nspending relating to our advertising and promotional activities in support of our products and services.\\nThe main components of our general and administrative expenses are:\\n•\\ncompensation expenses for employees in finance, human resources, information technology, legal, and other \\nadministrative support functions; \\n•\\nexpenses relating to legal matters, including certain fines and settlements; and \\n•\\nthird-party services fees, including audit, consulting, outside legal, and other outsourced administrative \\nservices.\\nOther Income (Expense), Net \\nOI&E, net primarily consists of interest income (expense), the effect of foreign currency exchange gains (losses), \\nnet gains (losses) and impairment on our marketable and non-marketable securities, performance fees, and income \\n(loss) and impairment from our equity method investments. \\nFor additional information, including how we account for our investments and factors that can drive fluctuations in \\nthe value of our investments, see Note 1 and Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in \\nPart II, Item 8 as well as Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk of this Annual Report on \\nForm 10-K.\\nProvision for Income Taxes \\nProvision for income taxes represents the estimated amount of federal, state, and foreign income taxes incurred \\nin the U.S. and the many jurisdictions in which we operate.

A cumulative one-time adjustment applicable \\nto the prior period for these tax rule changes was recorded in 2023.\\nThe effective tax rate decreased from 2022 to 2023, reflecting the effect of the two tax rule changes described \\nabove, particularly the change related to foreign tax credits. The effect of these tax rule changes was partially offset by \\nchanges in uncertain tax benefits and a decrease in the U.S. federal Foreign Derived Intangible Income tax deduction.\\nThe OECD is coordinating negotiations among more than 140 countries with the goal of achieving consensus \\naround substantial changes to international tax policies, including the implementation of a minimum global effective tax \\nrate of 15%. While various countries have implemented the legislation as of January 1, 2024, we do not expect a \\nresulting material change to our income tax provision for the 2024 fiscal year. As additional jurisdictions enact such \\nlegislation, we expect our effective tax rate and cash tax payments could increase in future years. \\nFinancial Condition\\nCash, Cash Equivalents, and Marketable Securities\\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had $110.9 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term marketable securities. \\nCash equivalents and marketable securities are comprised of time deposits, money market funds, highly liquid \\ngovernment bonds, corporate debt securities, mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities, and marketable equity \\nsecurities.\\nSources, Uses of Cash and Related Trends\\nOur principal sources of liquidity are cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, as well as the cash flow \\nthat we generate from operations. The primary use of capital continues to be to invest for the long-term growth of the \\nbusiness. We regularly evaluate our cash and capital structure, including the size, pace, and form of capital return to \\nstockholders.\\nTable of Contents\\nAlphabet Inc.\\n40.  \\nThe following table presents our cash flows (in millions):\\n \\nYear Ended December 31,\\n \\n2022\\n2023\\nNet cash provided by operating activities\\n$ \\n91,495 $ \\n101,746 \\nNet cash used in investing activities\\n$ \\n(20,298) $ \\n(27,063) \\nNet cash used in financing activities\\n$ \\n(69,757) $ \\n(72,093) \\nCash Provided by Operating Activities\\nOur largest source of cash provided by operations are advertising revenues generated by Google Search & other \\nproperties, Google Network properties, and YouTube properties. In Google Services, we also generate cash through \\nconsumer subscriptions and the sale of apps and in-app purchases and devices. In Google Cloud we generate cash \\nthrough consumption-based fees and subscriptions for infrastructure, platform, collaboration tools, and other cloud \\nservices.\\nOur primary uses of cash from operating activities include payments to distribution and Google Network partners, \\nto employees for compensation, and to content providers. Other uses of cash from operating activities include \\npayments to suppliers for devices, to tax authorities for income taxes, and other general corporate expenditures.\\nNet cash provided by operating activities increased from 2022 to 2023 due to the increase in cash received from \\ncustomers, partially offset by increases in cash paid for cost of revenues and operating expenses.\\nCash Used in Investing Activities\\nCash provided by investing activities consists primarily of maturities and sales of investments in marketable and \\nnon-marketable securities. Cash used in investing activities consists primarily of purchases of marketable and non-\\nmarketable securities, purchases of property and equipment, and payments for acquisitions.\\nNet cash used in investing activities increased from 2022 to 2023 due to a decrease in maturities and sales of \\nmarketable securities, partially offset by a decrease in payments for acquisitions.\\nCash Used in Financing Activities\\nCash provided by financing activities consists primarily of proceeds from issuance of debt and proceeds from the \\nsale of interests in consolidated entities. Cash used in financing activities consists primarily of repurchases of stock, \\nnet payments related to stock-based award activities, and repayments of debt.\\nNet cash used in financing activities increased from 2022 to 2023 due to an increase in repurchases of stock.\\nLiquidity and Material Cash Requirements\\nWe expect existing cash, cash equivalents, short-term marketable securities, cash flows from operations and \\nfinancing activities to continue to be sufficient to fund our operating activities and cash commitments for investing and \\nfinancing activities for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future.\\nCapital Expenditures and Leases\\nWe make investments in land and buildings for data centers and offices and information technology assets \\nthrough purchases of property and equipment and lease arrangements to provide capacity for the growth of our \\nservices and products.\\nCapital Expenditures\\nOur capital investments in property and equipment consist primarily of the following major categories:\\n•\\ntechnical infrastructure, which consists of our investments in servers and network equipment for computing, \\nstorage, and networking requirements for ongoing business activities, including AI, (collectively referred to as \\nour information technology assets) and data center land and building construction; and\\n•\\noffice facilities, ground-up development projects, and building improvements (also referred to as \"fit-outs\").\\nConstruction in progress consists primarily of technical infrastructure and office facilities which have not yet been \\nplaced in service. The time frame from date of purchase to placement in service of these assets may extend from \\nmonths to years. For example, our data center construction projects are generally multi-year projects with multiple \\nphases, where we acquire land and buildings, construct buildings, and secure and install information technology \\nassets.\\nTable of Contents\\nAlphabet Inc.\\n41.  \\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2023, we spent $31.5 billion and $32.3 billion on capital \\nexpenditures, respectively. We expect to increase, relative to 2023, our investment in our technical infrastructure, \\nincluding servers, network equipment, and data centers, to support the growth of our business and our long-term \\ninitiatives, in particular in support of AI products and services. Depreciation of our property and equipment commences \\nwhen the deployment of such assets are completed and are ready for our intended use. Land is not depreciated. For \\nthe years ended December 31, 2022 and 2023, our depreciation on property and equipment were $13.5 billion and \\n$11.9 billion, respectively.  \\nLeases \\nFor the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2023, we recognized total operating lease assets of $4.4 billion and \\n$2.9 billion, respectively. As of December 31, 2023, the amount of total future lease payments under operating leases, \\nwhich had a weighted average remaining lease term of eight years, was $17.7 billion, of which $3.2 billion is short-\\nterm. As of December 31, 2023, we have entered into leases that have not yet commenced with future short-term and \\nlong-term lease payments of $657 million and $3.3 billion, that are not yet recorded on our Consolidated Balance \\nSheets. These leases will commence between 2024 and 2026 with non-cancelable lease terms of one to 25 years. \\nFor the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2023, our operating lease expenses (including variable lease costs) \\nwere $3.7 billion and $4.5 billion, respectively. Finance lease costs were not material for the years ended \\nDecember 31, 2022 and 2023. For additional information, see Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial \\nStatements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\\nFinancing\\nWe have a short-term debt financing program of up to $10.0 billion through the issuance of commercial paper. Net \\nproceeds from this program are used for general corporate purposes. As of December 31, 2023, we had no \\ncommercial paper outstanding.\\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had $10.0 billion of revolving credit facilities, $4.0 billion expiring in April 2024 and \\n$6.0 billion expiring in April 2028. The interest rates for all credit facilities are determined based on a formula using \\ncertain market rates, as well as our progress toward the achievement of certain sustainability goals. No amounts have \\nbeen borrowed under the credit facilities.\\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had senior unsecured notes outstanding with a total carrying value of $12.9 billion \\nwith short-term and long-term future interest payments of $214 million and $3.6 billion, respectively. For additional \\ninformation, see Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on \\nForm 10-K.\\nWe primarily utilize contract manufacturers for the assembly of our servers used in our technical infrastructure \\nand devices we sell. We have agreements where we may purchase components directly from suppliers and then \\nsupply these components to contract manufacturers for use in the assembly of the servers and devices. Certain of \\nthese arrangements result in a portion of the cash received from and paid to the contract manufacturers to be \\npresented as financing activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows included in Item 8 of this Annual \\nReport on Form 10-K.\\nShare Repurchase Program\\nDuring 2023 we repurchased and subsequently retired 528 million shares for $62.2 billion.\\nIn April 2023, the Board of Directors of Alphabet authorized the company to repurchase up to an additional $70.0 \\nbillion of its Class A and Class C shares.

On September 14, 2022, the General \\nCourt reduced the 2018 fine from €4.3 billion to €4.1 billion. We subsequently filed an appeal to the European Court of \\nJustice.\\nWhile each EC decision is under appeal, we included the fines in accrued expenses and other current liabilities \\non our Consolidated Balance Sheets as we provided bank guarantees (in lieu of a cash payment) for the fines. For \\nadditional information, see Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual \\nReport on Form 10-K.\\nTaxes\\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had income taxes payable of $4.2 billion, of which $2.1 billion was short-term, \\nrelated to a one-time transition tax payable incurred as a result of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\"Tax Act\"). As \\npermitted by the Tax Act, we will pay the transition tax in annual interest-free installments through 2025. We also have \\nlong-term taxes payable of $6.3 billion primarily related to uncertain tax positions as of December 31, 2023.\\nPurchase Commitments and Other Contractual Obligations\\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had material purchase commitments and other contractual obligations of $45.9 \\nbillion, of which $31.6 billion was short-term. These amounts primarily consist of purchase orders for certain technical \\ninfrastructure as well as the non-cancelable portion or the minimum cancellation fee in certain agreements related to \\ncommitments to purchase licenses, including content licenses, inventory and network capacity. For those agreements \\nwith variable terms, we do not estimate the non-cancelable obligation beyond any minimum quantities and/or pricing as \\nof December 31, 2023. In certain instances, the amount of our contractual obligations may change based on the \\nexpected timing of order fulfillment from our suppliers. For more information related to our content licenses, see Note \\n10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\\nIn addition, we regularly enter into multi-year, non-cancellable agreements to purchase renewable energy and \\nenergy attributes, such as renewable energy certificates. These agreements do not include a minimum dollar \\ncommitment. The amounts to be paid under these agreements are based on the actual volumes to be generated and \\nare not readily determinable.\\nCritical Accounting Estimates\\nWe prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP. In doing so, we have to make \\nestimates and assumptions. Our critical accounting estimates are those estimates that involve a significant level of \\nuncertainty at the time the estimate was made, and changes in them have had or are reasonably likely to have a \\nmaterial effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Accordingly, actual results could differ materially from \\nour estimates. We base our estimates on past experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable \\nunder the circumstances, and we evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis. We have reviewed our critical \\naccounting estimates with the Audit and Compliance Committee of our Board of Directors.\\nFor a summary of significant accounting policies and the effect on our financial statements, see Note 1 of the \\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\\nFair Value Measurements of Non-Marketable Equity Securities\\nWe measure certain financial instruments at fair value on a nonrecurring basis, consisting primarily of our non-\\nmarketable equity securities. These investments are accounted for under the measurement alternative method (\"the \\nmeasurement alternative\") and are measured at cost, less impairment, subject to upward and downward adjustments \\nresulting from observable price changes for identical or similar investments of the same issuer. These adjustments \\nrequire quantitative assessments of the fair value of our securities, which may require the use of unobservable inputs. \\nAdjustments are determined primarily based on a market approach as of the transaction date and involve the use of \\nestimates using the best information available, which may include cash flow projections or other available market data.\\nNon-marketable equity securities are also evaluated for impairment, based on qualitative factors including the \\ncompanies\\' financial and liquidity position and access to capital resources, among others. When indicators of \\nimpairment exist, we prepare quantitative measurements of the fair value of our equity investments using a market \\napproach or an income approach, which requires judgment and the use of unobservable inputs, including discount \\nrates, investee revenues and costs, and comparable market data of private and public companies, among others. \\nTable of Contents\\nAlphabet Inc.\\n43.  \\nWhen the quantitative remeasurements of fair value indicate an impairment exists, we write down the investment to its \\ncurrent fair value.\\nWe also have compensation arrangements with payouts based on realized returns from certain investments, i.e. \\nperformance fees. We record compensation expense based on the estimated payouts on an ongoing basis, which may \\nresult in expense recognized before investment returns are realized and compensation is paid and may require the use \\nof unobservable inputs.\\nProperty and Equipment\\nWe assess the reasonableness of the useful lives of our property and equipment periodically as well as when \\nother changes occur, such as when there are changes to ongoing business operations, changes in the planned use \\nand utilization of assets, or technological advancements, that could indicate a change in the period over which we \\nexpect to benefit from the assets. \\nIncome Taxes\\nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in evaluating \\nour uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes.\\nRecording an uncertain tax position involves various qualitative considerations, including evaluation of \\ncomparable and resolved tax exposures, applicability of tax laws, and likelihood of settlement. We evaluate uncertain \\ntax positions periodically, considering changes in facts and circumstances, such as new regulations or recent judicial \\nopinions, as well as the status of audit activities by taxing authorities. Although we believe we have adequately \\nreserved for our uncertain tax positions, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not \\nbe different. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such \\ndifferences will affect the provision for income taxes and the effective tax rate in the period in which such determination \\nis made.\\nThe provision for income taxes includes the effect of reserve provisions and changes to reserves as well as the \\nrelated net interest and penalties. In addition, we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns \\nby the IRS and other tax authorities which may assert assessments against us. We regularly assess the likelihood of \\nadverse outcomes resulting from these examinations and assessments to determine the adequacy of our provision for \\nincome taxes.\\nLoss Contingencies\\nWe are regularly subject to claims, lawsuits, regulatory and government investigations, other proceedings, and \\nconsent orders involving competition, intellectual property, privacy, data security, tax and related compliance, labor and \\nemployment, commercial disputes, content generated by our users, goods and services offered by advertisers or \\npublishers using our platforms, personal injury consumer protection, and other matters. Certain of these matters \\ninclude speculative claims for substantial or indeterminate amounts of damages. We record a liability when we believe \\nthat it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. If we determine that a \\nloss is reasonably possible and the loss or range of loss can be estimated, we disclose the possible loss in Note 10 of \\nthe Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. \\nWe evaluate, on a regular basis, developments in our legal matters that could affect the amount of liability that \\nhas been previously accrued, and the matters and related reasonably possible losses disclosed, and make \\nadjustments and changes to our disclosures. Significant judgment is required to determine both the likelihood and the \\nestimated amount of a loss related to such matters. Until the final resolution of such matters, there may be an \\nexposure to loss in excess of the amount recorded, and such amounts could be material.\\nChange in Accounting Estimate\\nIn January 2023, we completed an assessment of the useful lives of our servers and network equipment resulting \\nin a change in the estimated useful life of our servers and certain network equipment to six years. This change in \\naccounting estimate was effective beginning fiscal year 2023. For additional information, see Note 1 of the Notes to \\nConsolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\\nTable of Contents\\nAlphabet Inc.\\n44.  \\nITEM 7A.\\nQUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\\nWe are exposed to financial market risks, including changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, \\nand equity investment risks. \\nForeign Currency Exchange Risk\\nWe transact business globally in multiple currencies. International revenues, as well as costs and expenses \\ndenominated in foreign currencies, expose us to the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates against the \\nU.S. dollar. As discussed below, we enter into derivative instruments to hedge foreign currency risk. Principal \\ncurrencies hedged included the Australian dollar, British pound, Canadian dollar, Euro, and Japanese yen. For the \\npurpose of analyzing foreign currency exchange risk, we considered the historical trends in foreign currency exchange \\nrates and determined that it was reasonably possible that adverse changes in exchange rates of 10% could be \\nexperienced.\\nWe use foreign currency forward and option contracts to offset the foreign exchange risk on assets and liabilities \\ndenominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the subsidiary. These forward and option contracts \\nreduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the effect of foreign currency exchange rate movements on our assets and \\nliabilities. The foreign currency gains and losses on these assets and liabilities are recorded in OI&E, which are offset \\nby the gains and losses on the forward and option contracts.\\nIf an adverse 10% foreign currency exchange rate change was applied to total monetary assets, liabilities, and \\ncommitments denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies at the balance sheet date, it would have \\nresulted in an adverse effect on income before income taxes of approximately $136 million and $503 million as of \\nDecember 31, 2022 and 2023, respectively, after consideration of the effect of foreign exchange contracts in place for \\nthe years ended December 31, 2022 and 2023.\\nWe use foreign currency forward and option contracts, including collars (an option strategy comprised of a \\ncombination of purchased and written options) to protect forecasted U.S. dollar-equivalent earnings from changes in \\nforeign currency exchange rates. When the U.S. dollar strengthens, gains from foreign currency forward and option \\ncontacts reduce the foreign currency losses related to our earnings. When the U.S. dollar weakens, losses from foreign \\ncurrency forward and option contracts offset the foreign currency gains related to our earnings. These hedging \\ncontracts reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the effect of foreign currency exchange rate movements. We designate \\nthese contracts as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes. We reflect the gains or losses of foreign currency spot \\nrate changes as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) and subsequently reclassify them \\ninto revenues to offset the hedged exposures as they occur. \\nIf the U.S. dollar weakened by 10% as of December 31, 2022 and 2023, the amount recorded in AOCI related to \\nour cash flow hedges before tax effect would have been approximately $1.3 billion and $1.5 billion lower as of \\nDecember 31, 2022 and 2023, respectively. The change in the value recorded in AOCI would be expected to offset a \\ncorresponding foreign currency change in forecasted hedged revenues when recognized.\\nWe use foreign exchange forward contracts designated as net investment hedges to hedge the foreign currency \\nrisks related to investment in foreign subsidiaries. These forward contracts serve to offset the foreign currency \\ntranslation risk from our foreign operations.\\nIf the U.S. dollar weakened by 10%, the amount recorded in cumulative translation adjustment (CTA) within AOCI \\nrelated to our net investment hedges before tax effect would have been approximately $903 million and $946 million \\nlower as of December 31, 2022 and 2023, respectively. The change in value recorded in CTA would be expected to \\noffset a corresponding foreign currency translation gain or loss from our investment in foreign subsidiaries.\\nInterest Rate Risk\\nOur Corporate Treasury investment strategy is to achieve a return that will allow us to preserve capital and \\nmaintain liquidity. We invest primarily in debt securities, including government bonds, corporate debt securities, \\nmortgage-backed and asset-backed securities, money market and other funds, time deposits, and interest rate \\nderivatives. By policy, we limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. Our investments in both fixed rate and \\nfloating rate interest earning securities carry a degree of interest rate risk. Fixed rate securities may have their fair \\nmarket value adversely affected due to a rise in interest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income \\nthan predicted if interest rates fall. Unrealized gains or losses on our marketable debt securities are primarily due to \\ninterest rate fluctuations as compared to interest rates at the time of purchase. For certain fixed and variable rate debt \\nsecurities, we have elected the fair value option for which changes in fair value are recorded in OI&E. We measure \\nsecurities for which we have not elected the fair value option at fair value with gains and losses recorded in AOCI until \\nthe securities are sold, less any expected credit losses. \\nTable of Contents\\nAlphabet Inc.\\n45.  \\nWe use value-at-risk (VaR) analysis to determine the potential effect of fluctuations in interest rates on the value \\nof our marketable debt security portfolio. The VaR is the expected loss in fair value, for a given confidence interval, for \\nour investment portfolio due to adverse movements in interest rates. We use a variance/covariance VaR model with \\n95% confidence interval. The estimated one-day loss in fair value of marketable debt securities as of December 31, \\n2022 and 2023 are shown below (in millions):\\n \\nAs of December 31,\\n12-Month Average \\nAs of December 31,\\n \\n2022\\n2023\\n2022\\n2023\\nRisk category - interest rate\\n$ \\n256 $ \\n296 $ \\n198 $ \\n271 \\nActual future gains and losses associated with our marketable debt security portfolio may differ materially from the \\nsensitivity analyses performed as of December 31, 2022 and 2023 due to the inherent limitations associated with \\npredicting the timing and amount of changes in interest rates and our actual exposures and positions. VaR analysis is \\nnot intended to represent actual losses but is used as a risk estimation.\\nEquity Investment Risk\\nOur marketable and non-marketable equity securities are subject to a wide variety of market-related risks that \\ncould substantially reduce or increase the fair value of our holdings.\\nOur marketable equity securities are publicly traded stocks or funds and our non-marketable equity securities are \\ninvestments in privately held companies, some of which are in the startup or development stages.\\nWe record marketable equity securities not accounted for under the equity method at fair value based on readily \\ndeterminable market values, of which publicly traded stocks and mutual funds are subject to market price volatility, and \\nrepresent $5.2 billion and $6.0 billion of our investments as of December 31, 2022 and 2023, respectively. A \\nhypothetical adverse price change of 10% on our December 31, 2023 balance would decrease the fair value of \\nmarketable equity securities by $597 million. From time to time, we may enter into derivatives to hedge the market \\nprice risk on certain of our marketable equity securities.\\nOur non-marketable equity securities not accounted for under the equity method are adjusted to fair value for \\nobservable transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer or impairment (referred to as the \\nmeasurement alternative). The fair value measured at the time of the observable transaction is not necessarily an \\nindication of the current fair value as of the balance sheet date. These investments, especially those that are in the \\nearly stages, are inherently risky because the technologies or products these companies have under development are \\ntypically in the early phases and may never materialize, and they may experience a decline in financial condition, \\nwhich could result in a loss of a substantial part of our investment in these companies. Valuations of our equity \\ninvestments in private companies are inherently more complex due to the lack of readily available market data and \\nobservable transactions at lower valuations could result in significant losses. In addition, global economic conditions \\ncould result in additional volatility. The success of our investment in any private company is also typically dependent on \\nthe likelihood of our ability to realize appreciation in the value of investments through liquidity events such as public \\nofferings, acquisitions, private sales or other market events. Changes in the valuation of non-marketable equity \\nsecurities may not directly correlate with changes in valuation of marketable equity securities. As of December 31, \\n2022 and 2023, the carrying value of our non-marketable equity securities, which were accounted for under the \\nmeasurement alternative, was $28.5 billion and $28.8 billion, respectively. \\nThe carrying values of our equity method investments, which totaled approximately $1.7 billion as of \\nDecember 31, 2022 and 2023, generally do not fluctuate based on market price changes. However, these investments \\ncould be impaired if the carrying value exceeds the fair value and is not expected to recover.\\nFor additional information about our equity investments, see Note 1 and Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated \\nFinancial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\\nTable of Contents\\nAlphabet Inc.\\n46.  \\nITEM 8.\\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\\nAlphabet Inc.\\nINDEX TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\n \\nPage\\nReports of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm (PCAOB ID: 42)\\n48\\nFinancial Statements:\\nConsolidated Balance Sheets\\n51\\nConsolidated Statements of Income\\n52\\nConsolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income\\n53\\nConsolidated Statements of Stockholders’ Equity\\n54\\nConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows\\n55\\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\\n56\\nTable of Contents\\nAlphabet Inc.\\n47.  \\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\\nTo the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Alphabet Inc.\\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Alphabet Inc. (the Company) as of December 31, \\n2022 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders\\' equity and cash \\nflows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023, and the related notes and financial \\nstatement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15 (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In \\nour opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the \\nCompany at December 31, 2022 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three \\nyears in the period ended December 31, 2023, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United \\nStates) (PCAOB), the Company\\'s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria \\nestablished in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the \\nTreadway Commission (2013 framework), and our report dated January 30, 2024 expressed an unqualified opinion \\nthereon.\\nBasis for Opinion\\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company\\'s management. Our responsibility is to express an \\nopinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with \\nthe PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal \\nsecurities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and \\nperform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material \\nmisstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material \\nmisstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to \\nthose risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in \\nthe financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates \\nmade by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our \\naudits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\\nCritical Audit Matter\\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial \\nstatements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to \\naccounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, \\nsubjective or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion \\non the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter \\nbelow, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the account or disclosure to which it relates. \\nTable of Contents\\nAlphabet Inc.\\n48.  \\nLoss Contingencies \\nDescription of \\nthe Matter\\nThe Company is regularly subject to claims, lawsuits, regulatory and government investigations, \\nother proceedings, and consent orders involving competition, intellectual property, data privacy and \\nsecurity, tax and related compliance, labor and employment, commercial disputes, content \\ngenerated by its users, goods and services offered by advertisers or publishers using their \\nplatforms, personal injury, consumer protection, and other matters. As described in Note 10 to the \\nconsolidated financial statements “Commitments and contingencies” such claims, lawsuits, \\nregulatory and government investigations, other proceedings, and consent orders could result in \\nadverse consequences.\\nSignificant judgment is required to determine both the likelihood, and the estimated amount, of a \\nloss related to such matters. Auditing management’s accounting for and disclosure of loss \\ncontingencies from these matters involved challenging and subjective auditor judgment in \\nassessing the Company’s evaluation of the probability of a loss, and the estimated amount or \\nrange of loss.\\nHow We \\nAddressed the \\nMatter in Our \\nAudit\\nWe tested relevant controls over the identified risks associated with management’s accounting for \\nand disclosure of these matters. This included controls over management’s assessment of the \\nprobability of incurrence of a loss and whether the loss or range of loss was reasonably estimable \\nand the development of related disclosures.\\nOur audit procedures included gaining an understanding of previous rulings and the status of \\nongoing lawsuits, reviewing letters addressing the matters from internal and external legal counsel, \\nmeeting with internal legal counsel to discuss the allegations, and obtaining a representation letter \\nfrom management on these matters. We also evaluated the Company’s disclosures in relation to \\nthese matters.\\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\\nWe have served as the Company\\'s auditor since 1999.\\nSan Jose, California\\nJanuary 30, 2024\\nTable of Contents\\nAlphabet Inc.\\n49.  \\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\\nTo the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Alphabet Inc.\\nOpinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\\nWe have audited Alphabet Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria \\nestablished in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the \\nTreadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Alphabet Inc. (the Company) maintained, \\nin all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on the COSO \\ncriteria.\\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United \\nStates) (PCAOB), the 2023 consolidated financial statements of the Company and our report dated January 30, 2024 \\nexpressed an unqualified opinion thereon. \\nBasis for Opinion\\nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its \\nassessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying \\nManagement’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the \\nCompany’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with \\nthe PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal \\nsecurities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and \\nperform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was \\nmaintained in all material respects. \\nOur audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a \\nmaterial weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on \\nthe assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We \\nbelieve that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding \\nthe reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with \\ngenerally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies \\nand procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the \\ntransactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are \\nrecorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting \\nprinciples, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations \\nof management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely \\ndetection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on \\nthe financial statements.\\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. \\nAlso, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become \\ninadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may \\ndeteriorate.\\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\\nSan Jose, California\\nJanuary 30, 2024\\nTable of Contents\\nAlphabet Inc.\\n50.  \\nAlphabet Inc.\\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\\n(in millions, except par

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\\nNature of Operations\\nGoogle was incorporated in California in September 1998 and re-incorporated in the State of Delaware in August \\n2003. In 2015, we implemented a holding company reorganization, and as a result, Alphabet Inc. (\"Alphabet\") became \\nthe successor issuer to Google.\\nWe generate revenues by delivering relevant, cost-effective online advertising; cloud-based solutions that provide \\nenterprise customers with infrastructure and platform services as well as communication and collaboration tools; sales \\nof other products and services, such as fees received for consumer subscription-based products, apps and in-app \\npurchases, and devices.\\nBasis of Consolidation\\nThe consolidated financial statements of Alphabet include the accounts of Alphabet and entities consolidated \\nunder the variable interest and voting models. Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.\\nUse of Estimates\\nPreparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and \\nassumptions that affect the amounts reported and disclosed in the financial statements and the accompanying notes. \\nActual results could differ materially from these estimates due to uncertainties. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our \\nestimates, including those related to the allowance for credit losses; content licenses; contingent liabilities; fair values \\nof financial instruments and goodwill; income taxes; inventory; and useful lives of property and equipment, among \\nothers. We base our estimates on assumptions, both historical and forward looking, that are believed to be reasonable, \\nand the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities.\\nIn January 2023, we completed an assessment of the useful lives of our servers and network equipment and \\nadjusted the estimated useful life of our servers from four years to six years and the estimated useful life of certain \\nnetwork equipment from five years to six years. This change in accounting estimate was effective beginning in fiscal \\nyear 2023. Based on the carrying value of servers and certain network equipment as of December 31, 2022, and those \\nplaced in service during the year ended December 31, 2023, the effect of this change in estimate was a reduction in \\ndepreciation expense of $3.9 billion and an increase in net income of $3.0 billion, or $0.24 per basic and $0.24 per \\ndiluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2023.\\nRevenue Recognition\\nRevenues are recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to our customers, and \\nthe collectibility of an amount that we expect in exchange for those goods or services is probable. Sales and other \\nsimilar taxes are excluded from revenues. \\nAdvertising Revenues\\nWe generate advertising revenues primarily by delivering advertising on:\\n•\\nGoogle Search and other properties, including revenues from traffic generated by search distribution partners \\nwho use Google.com as their default search in browsers, toolbars, etc. and other Google owned and operated \\nproperties like Gmail, Google Maps, and Google Play;\\n•\\nYouTube properties; and\\n•\\nGoogle Network properties, including revenues from Google Network properties participating in AdMob, \\nAdSense, and Google Ad Manager.\\nOur customers generally purchase advertising inventory through Google Ads, Google Ad Manager, Google \\nDisplay & Video 360, and Google Marketing Platform, among others.\\nWe offer advertising by delivering both performance and brand advertising. We recognize revenues for \\nperformance advertising when a user engages with the advertisement. For brand advertising, we recognize revenues \\nwhen the ad is displayed, or a user views the ad.\\nFor ads placed on Google Network properties, we evaluate whether we are the principal (i.e., report revenues on \\na gross basis) or agent (i.e., report revenues on a net basis). Generally, we report advertising revenues for ads placed \\non Google Network properties on a gross basis, that is, the amounts billed to our customers are recorded as revenues, \\nTable of Contents\\nAlphabet Inc.\\n56.  \\nand amounts paid to Google Network partners are recorded as cost of revenues. Where we are the principal, we \\ncontrol the advertising inventory before it is transferred to our customers. Our control is evidenced by our sole ability to \\nmonetize the advertising inventory before it is transferred to our customers and is further supported by us being \\nprimarily responsible to our customers and having a level of discretion in establishing pricing.\\nGoogle Subscriptions, Platforms, and Devices\\nGoogle subscriptions, platforms, and devices revenues consist of revenues from:\\n•\\nconsumer subscriptions, which primarily include revenues from YouTube services, such YouTube TV, YouTube \\nMusic and Premium, and NFL Sunday Ticket, as well as Google One;\\n•\\nplatforms, which primarily include revenues from Google Play from the sales of apps and in-app purchases;\\n•\\ndevices, which primarily include sales of the Pixel family of devices; and\\n•\\nother products and services.\\nSubscription revenues are recognized ratably over the period of the subscription, primarily monthly. We report \\nrevenues from Google Play app sales and in-app purchases on a net basis, because our performance obligation is to \\nfacilitate a transaction between app developers and end users, for which we earn a service fee. \\nGoogle Cloud Revenues\\nGoogle Cloud revenues consist of revenues from:\\n•\\nGoogle Cloud Platform, which generates consumption-based fees and subscriptions for infrastructure, \\nplatform, and other services. These services provide access to solutions such as cybersecurity, databases, \\nanalytics, and AI offerings including our AI infrastructure, Vertex AI platform, and Duet AI for Google Cloud;\\n•\\nGoogle Workspace, which includes subscriptions for cloud-based communication and collaboration tools for \\nenterprises, such as Calendar, Gmail, Docs, Drive, and Meet, with integrated features like Duet AI in Google \\nWorkspace; and\\n•\\nother enterprise services.\\nOur cloud services are generally provided on either a consumption or subscription basis and may have contract \\nterms longer than a year. Revenues related to cloud services provided on a consumption basis are recognized when \\nthe customer utilizes the services, based on the quantity of services consumed. Revenues related to cloud services \\nprovided on a subscription basis are recognized ratably over the contract term as the customer receives and \\nconsumes the benefits of the cloud services.\\nArrangements with Multiple Performance Obligations\\nOur contracts with customers may include multiple performance obligations. For such arrangements, we allocate \\nrevenues to each performance obligation based on its relative standalone selling price. We generally determine \\nstandalone selling prices based on the prices charged to customers.\\nCustomer Incentives and Credits\\nCertain customers receive cash-based incentives or credits, which are accounted for as variable consideration. \\nWe estimate these amounts based on the expected amount to be provided to customers and reduce revenues. We \\nbelieve that there will not be significant changes to our estimates of variable consideration.\\nSales Commissions\\nWe expense sales commissions when incurred when the period of the expected benefit is one year or less. We \\nrecognize an asset for certain sales commissions and amortize if the expected benefit period is greater than one year. \\nThese costs are recorded within sales and marketing expenses.\\nCost of Revenues\\nCost of revenues consists of TAC and other costs of revenues.\\n•\\nTAC includes: \\n◦\\namounts paid to our distribution partners who make available our search access points and services. \\nOur distribution partners include browser providers, mobile carriers, original equipment manufacturers, \\nand software developers; and\\n◦\\namounts paid to Google Network partners primarily for ads displayed on their properties.\\nTable of Contents\\nAlphabet Inc.\\n57.  \\n•\\nOther cost of revenues includes:\\n◦\\ncompensation expense related to our data centers and other operations such as content review and \\ncustomer and product support;\\n◦\\ncontent acquisition costs, which are payments to content providers from whom we license video and \\nother content for distribution on YouTube and Google Play (we pay fees to these content providers \\nbased on revenues generated or a flat fee);\\n◦\\ndepreciation expense related to our technical infrastructure; and\\n◦\\ninventory and other costs related to the devices we sell.\\nSoftware Development Costs\\nWe expense software development costs, including costs to develop software products or the software \\ncomponent of products to be sold, leased, or marketed to external users, before technological feasibility is reached. \\nTechnological feasibility is typically reached shortly before the release of such products. As a result, development costs \\nthat meet the criteria for capitalization were not material for the periods presented.\\nSoftware development costs also include costs to develop software to be used solely to meet internal needs and \\ncloud-based applications used to deliver our services. We capitalize development costs related to these software \\napplications once the preliminary project stage is complete and it is probable that the project will be completed and the \\nsoftware will be used to perform the function intended. Costs capitalized for developing such software applications \\nwere not material for the periods presented.\\nStock-based Compensation \\nStock-based compensation (SBC) primarily consists of Alphabet restricted stock units (RSUs). RSUs are equity \\nclassified and measured at the fair market value of the underlying stock at the grant date. We recognize RSU expense \\nusing the straight-line attribution method over the requisite service period and account for forfeitures as they occur.\\nFor RSUs, shares are issued on the vesting dates net of the applicable statutory income tax withholding to be \\npaid by us on behalf of our employees. As a result, fewer shares are issued than the number of RSUs outstanding, and \\nthe income tax withholding is recorded as a reduction to additional paid-in capital.\\nAdditionally, SBC includes other stock-based awards, such as performance stock units (PSUs) that include \\nmarket conditions and awards that may be settled in cash or the stock of certain Other Bet companies. PSUs and \\ncertain awards granted by Other Bet companies are equity classified and expense is recognized over the requisite \\nservice period. Certain awards granted by Other Bet companies are liability classified and remeasured at fair value \\nthrough settlement. The fair value of awards granted by Other Bet companies is based on the equity valuation of the \\nrespective Other Bet company.\\nAdvertising and Promotional Expenses\\nWe expense advertising and promotional costs in the period in which they are incurred. For the years ended \\nDecember 31, 2021, 2022, and 2023, advertising and promotional expenses totaled approximately $7.9 billion, $9.2 \\nbillion, and $8.7 billion, respectively.\\nPerformance Fees\\nPerformance fees refer to compensation arrangements with payouts based on realized returns from certain \\ninvestments. We record compensation expense based on the estimated payouts on an ongoing basis, which may \\nresult in expense recognized before investment returns are realized and compensation is paid and may require the use \\nof unobservable inputs. Performance fees are recorded as a component of OI&E.\\nFair Value Measurements \\nFair value is an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a \\nliability in an orderly transaction between market participants. As such, fair value is a market-based measurement that \\nis determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or a liability. Assets and \\nliabilities recorded at fair value are measured and classified in accordance with a three-tier fair value hierarchy based \\non the observability of the inputs available in the market used to measure fair value:\\nLevel 1 - Observable inputs that reflect quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active \\nmarkets.\\nTable of Contents\\nAlphabet Inc.\\n58.  \\nLevel 2 - Inputs that are based upon quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for \\nidentical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, and model-based valuation techniques for which all \\nsignificant inputs are observable in the market or can be derived from observable market data. Where applicable, \\nthese models project future cash flows and discount the future amounts to a present value using market-based \\nobservable inputs including interest rate curves, foreign exchange rates, and credit ratings.\\nLevel 3 - Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activities.\\nThe fair value hierarchy requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of \\nunobservable inputs when measuring fair value. The determination of fair value involves the use of appropriate \\nvaluation methods and relevant inputs into valuation models.\\nOur financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis include cash equivalents, \\nmarketable securities, derivative financial instruments, and certain non-marketable debt securities. Our financial assets \\nmeasured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis include non-marketable equity securities. Other financial assets and \\nliabilities are carried at cost with fair value disclosed, if required.\\nWe measure certain other instruments, including SBC awards settled in the stock of Other Bet companies, and \\ncertain assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination, also at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. \\nFinancial Instruments\\nOur financial instruments include cash, cash equivalents, marketable and non-marketable securities, derivative \\nfinancial instruments and accounts receivable.\\nCredit Risks\\nWe are subject to credit risk primarily from cash equivalents, marketable debt securities, derivative financial \\ninstruments, including foreign exchange contracts, and accounts receivable. We manage our credit risk exposure \\nthrough timely assessment of our counterparty creditworthiness, credit limits and use of collateral management. \\nForeign exchange contracts are transacted with various financial institutions with high credit standing. Accounts \\nreceivable are typically unsecured and are derived from revenues earned from customers located around the world. \\nWe manage our credit risk exposure by performing ongoing evaluations to determine customer credit and we limit the \\namount of credit we extend. We generally do not require collateral from our customers.\\nCash Equivalents\\nWe invest excess cash primarily in government bonds, corporate debt securities, mortgage-backed and asset-\\nbacked securities, time deposits, and money market funds.\\nMarketable Securities\\nWe classify all marketable debt securities that have effective maturities of three months or less from the date of \\npurchase as cash equivalents and those with effective maturities of greater than three months as marketable securities \\non our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We determine the appropriate classification of our investments in marketable \\ndebt securities at the time of purchase and reevaluate such designation at each balance sheet date. We have \\nclassified and accounted for our marketable debt securities as available-for-sale. After consideration of our risk versus \\nreward objectives, as well as our liquidity requirements, we may sell these debt securities prior to their effective \\nmaturities. As we view these securities as available to support current operations, we classify highly liquid securities \\nwith maturities beyond 12 months as current assets under the caption marketable securities on the Consolidated \\nBalance Sheets. We carry these securities at fair value, and report the unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, as a \\ncomponent of stockholders’ equity, except for the changes in allowance for expected credit losses, which are recorded \\nin OI&E. For certain marketable debt securities we have elected the fair value option, for which changes in fair value \\nare recorded in OI&E. We determine any realized gains or losses on the sale of marketable debt securities on a \\nspecific identification method, and we record such gains and losses as a component of OI&E.\\nOur investments in marketable equity securities are measured at fair value with the related gains and losses, \\nincluding unrealized, recognized in OI&E. We classify our marketable equity securities subject to long-term lock-up \\nrestrictions beyond 12 months as other non-current assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\\nNon-Marketable Securities\\nNon-marketable securities primarily consist of equity securities. We account for non-marketable equity securities \\nthrough which we exercise significant influence but do not have control over the investee under the equity method. All \\nother non-marketable equity securities that we hold are primarily accounted for under the measurement alternative. \\nUnder the measurement alternative, the carrying value is measured at cost, less any impairment, plus or minus \\nTable of Contents\\nAlphabet Inc.\\n59.  \\nchanges resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for identical or similar investments of the \\nsame issuer. Adjustments are determined primarily based on a market approach as of the transaction date and are \\nrecorded as a component of OI&E.\\nNon-marketable securities that do not have effective contractual maturity dates are classified as other non-\\ncurrent assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\\nDerivative Financial Instruments\\nSee Note 3 for the accounting policy pertaining to derivative financial instruments. \\nAccounts Receivable\\nOur payment terms for accounts receivable vary by the types and locations of our customers and the products or \\nservices offered. The term between invoicing and when payment is due is not significant. For certain products or \\nservices and customers, we require payment before the products or services are delivered to the customer. \\nAdditionally, accounts receivable includes amounts for services performed in advance of the right to invoice the \\ncustomer.\\nWe maintain an allowance for credit losses for accounts receivable, which is recorded as an offset to accounts \\nreceivable, and changes in such are classified as general and administrative expense in the Consolidated Statements \\nof Income. We assess collectibility by reviewing accounts receivable on a collective basis where similar characteristics \\nexist and on an individual basis when we identify specific customers with known disputes or collectibility issues. In \\ndetermining the amount of the allowance for credit losses, we consider historical collectibility based on past due status \\nand make judgments about the creditworthiness of customers based on ongoing credit evaluations. We also consider \\ncustomer-specific information, current market conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic \\nconditions.\\nOther\\nOur financial instruments also include debt and equity investments in companies with which we also entered into \\ncommercial arrangements at or near the same time. For these transactions, judgment is required in assessing the \\nsubstance of the arrangements, including assessing whether the components of the arrangements should be \\naccounted for as separate transactions under the applicable GAAP, and determining the value of the components of \\nthe arrangements, including the fair value of the investments. Additionally, if our investment in such companies \\nbecomes impaired, any remaining performance obligations would be reassessed and may be reduced.\\nImpairment of Investments\\nWe periodically review our debt and non-marketable equity securities for impairment. \\nFor debt securities in an unrealized loss position, we determine whether a credit loss exists. The credit loss is \\nestimated by considering available information relevant to the collectibility of the security and information about past \\nevents, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Any credit loss is recorded as a charge to OI&E, \\nnot to exceed the amount of the unrealized loss. Unrealized losses other than the credit loss are recognized in AOCI. If \\nwe have an intent to sell, or if it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell a debt security in an unrealized \\nloss position before recovery of its amortized cost basis, we will write down the security to its fair value and record the \\ncorresponding charge as a component of OI&E. \\nFor non-marketable equity securities, including equity method investments, we consider whether impairment \\nindicators exist by evaluating the companies\\' financial and liquidity position and access to capital resources, among \\nother indicators. If the assessment indicates that the investment is impaired, we write down the investment to its fair \\nvalue by recording the corresponding charge as a component of OI&E. We prepare quantitative measurements of the \\nfair value of our equity investments using a market approach or an income approach.\\nInventory\\nInventory consists primarily of finished goods and is stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Cost is \\ncomputed using the first-in, first-out method.\\nVariable Interest Entities\\nWe determine at the inception of each arrangement whether an entity in which we have made an investment or in \\nwhich we have other variable interests is considered a variable interest entity (VIE). We consolidate VIEs when we are \\nthe primary beneficiary. We are the primary beneficiary of a VIE when we have the power to direct activities that most \\nsignificantly affect the economic performance of the VIE and have the obligation to absorb the majority of their losses \\nTable of Contents\\nAlphabet Inc.\\n60.  \\nor benefits. If we are not the primary beneficiary in a VIE, we account for the investment or other variable interests in a \\nVIE in accordance with applicable GAAP.\\nPeriodically, we assess whether any changes in our interest or relationship with the entity affect our determination \\nof whether the entity is a VIE and, if so, whether we are the primary beneficiary. \\nProperty and Equipment\\nProperty and equipment includes the following categories: land and buildings, information technology assets, \\nconstruction in progress, leasehold improvements, and furniture and fixtures. Land and buildings include land, offices, \\ndata centers, and related building improvements. Information technology assets include servers and network \\nequipment. Construction in progress is the construction or development of property and equipment that have not yet \\nbeen placed in service. \\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is recorded using the \\nstraight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which we regularly evaluate. Land is not depreciated. \\nWe depreciate buildings over periods of seven to 25 years. We depreciate information technology assets generally \\nover a period of six years for servers and network equipment. We depreciate leasehold improvements over the shorter \\nof the remaining lease term or the estimated useful lives of the assets. Depreciation for buildings, information \\ntechnology assets, leasehold improvements, and furniture and fixtures commences once they are ready for our \\nintended use.\\nGoodwill\\nWe allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the expected benefit from the business combination. We \\nevaluate our reporting units periodically, as well as when changes in our operating segments occur. For changes in \\nreporting units, we reassign goodwill using a relative fair value allocation approach. We test our goodwill for \\nimpairment at least annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset may be \\nimpaired. Goodwill impairments were not material for the periods presented.\\nLeases\\nWe determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Our lease agreements generally contain lease and non-\\nlease components. Payments under our lease arrangements are primarily fixed. Non-lease components primarily \\ninclude payments for maintenance and utilities. We combine fixed payments for non-lease components with lease \\npayments and account for them together as a single lease component which increases the amount of our lease assets \\nand liabilities.\\nCertain lease agreements contain variable payments, which are expensed as incurred and not included in the \\nlease assets and liabilities. These amounts primarily include payments affected by the Consumer Price Index, and \\npayments for maintenance and utilities.\\nLease assets and liabilities are recognized at the present value of the future lease payments at the lease \\ncommencement date. The interest rate used to determine the present value of the future lease payments is our \\nincremental borrowing rate, because the interest rate implicit in our leases is not readily determinable. Our incremental \\nborrowing rate is estimated to approximate the interest rate on a collateralized basis with similar terms and payments, \\nand in economic environments where the leased asset is located. Our lease terms include periods under options to \\nextend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. We generally use the \\nbase, non-cancelable, lease term when determining the lease assets and liabilities. Lease assets also include any \\nprepaid lease payments and lease incentives.\\nOperating lease assets and liabilities are included on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The current portion of our \\noperating lease liabilities is included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities, and the long-term portion is \\nincluded in operating lease liabilities. Finance lease assets are included in property and equipment, net. Finance lease \\nliabilities are included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities or long-term debt.\\nOperating lease expense (excluding variable lease costs) is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease \\nterm.\\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\\nWe review leases, property and equipment, and intangible assets, excluding goodwill, for impairment when \\nevents or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable. The evaluation is performed \\nat the lowest level of identifiable cash flows independent of other assets. We measure recoverability of these assets by \\ncomparing the carrying amounts to the future undiscounted cash flows that the assets or the asset group are expected \\nTable of Contents\\nAlphabet Inc.\\n61.  \\nto generate. If the carrying value of the assets or asset group is not recoverable, the impairment recognized is \\nmeasured as the amount by which the carrying value exceeds its fair value. \\nIncome Taxes\\nWe account for income taxes using the asset and liability method, under which we recognize the amount of taxes \\npayable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences of \\nevents that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. We measure current and deferred tax \\nassets and liabilities based on provisions of enacted tax law. We evaluate the likelihood of future realization of our \\ndeferred tax assets based on all available evidence and establish a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets \\nwhen it is more likely than not that they will not be realized or release a valuation allowance to increase deferred tax \\nassets when it is more likely than not that they will be realized. We have elected to account for the tax effects of the \\nglobal intangible low tax Income provision as a current period expense.\\nWe recognize the financial statement effects of a tax position when it is more likely than not that, based on \\ntechnical merits, the position will be sustained upon examination. The tax benefits of the position recognized in the \\nfinancial statements are then measured based on the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely to be \\nrealized upon settlement with a taxing authority. In addition, we recognize interest and penalties related to \\nunrecognized tax benefits as a component of the income tax provision.\\nBusiness Combinations\\nWe include the results of operations of the businesses that we acquire as of the acquisition date. We allocate the \\npurchase price of the acquisitions to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values, \\nexcept for revenue contracts acquired, which are recognized in accordance with our revenue recognition policy. The \\nexcess of the purchase price over the fair values of identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. \\nAcquisition-related expenses are recognized separately from the business combination and are expensed as incurred.\\nForeign Currency\\nWe translate the financial statements of our international subsidiaries to U.S. dollars using month-end exchange \\nrates for assets and liabilities, and average rates for the annual period derived from month-end exchange rates for \\nrevenues, costs, and expenses. We record translation gains and losses in AOCI as a component of stockholders’ \\nequity. We reflect net foreign exchange transaction gains and losses resulting from the conversion of the transaction \\ncurrency to functional currency as a component of foreign currency exchange gain (loss) in OI&E.\\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\\nIn November 2023, the Financial Standards Accounting Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update \\n(ASU) 2023-07 \"Segment Reporting (Topic 280):Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures\" which expands \\nannual and interim disclosure requirements for reportable segments, primarily through enhanced disclosures about \\nsignificant segment expenses. ASU 2023-07 is effective for our annual periods beginning January 1, 2024, and for \\ninterim periods beginning January 1, 2025, with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the potential \\neffect that the updated standard will have on our financial statement disclosures.\\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09 \"Income Taxes (Topics 740): Improvements to Income Tax \\nDisclosures\" to expand the disclosure requirements for income taxes, specifically related to the rate reconciliation and \\nincome taxes paid. ASU 2023-09 is effective for our annual periods beginning January 1, 2025, with early adoption \\npermitted. We are currently evaluating the potential effect that the updated standard will have on our financial \\nstatement disclosures.\\nPrior Period Reclassifications\\nCertain amounts in prior periods have been reclassified to conform with current period presentation.\\nTable of Contents\\nAlphabet Inc.\\n62.  \\nNote 2.

Our revenue backlog represents commitments in customer contracts for future \\nservices that have not yet been recognized as revenue. The estimated revenue backlog and timing of revenue \\nrecognition for these commitments is largely driven by our ability to deliver in accordance with relevant contract terms \\nand when our customers utilize services. We expect to recognize approximately half of the revenue backlog as \\nrevenues over the next 24 months with the remaining to be recognized thereafter. Revenue backlog includes related \\ndeferred revenue currently recorded as well as amounts that will be invoiced in future periods, and excludes contracts \\nwith an original expected term of one year or less and cancellable contracts.\\nDeferred Revenues\\nWe record deferred revenues when cash payments are received or due in advance of our performance, including \\namounts which are refundable. Deferred revenues primarily relate to Google Cloud and Google subscriptions, \\nplatforms, and devices. Total deferred revenue as of December 31, 2022 was $4.5 billion, of which $2.4 billion was \\nrecognized as revenues for the year ended December 31, 2023.\\nNote 3.    Financial Instruments \\nFair Value Measurements\\nInvestments Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis\\nCash, cash equivalents, and marketable equity securities are measured at fair value and classified within Level 1 \\nTable of Contents\\nAlphabet Inc.\\n63.  \\nand Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy, because we use quoted prices for identical assets in active markets or inputs \\nthat are based upon quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets.\\nDebt securities are measured at fair value and classified within Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy, because we use \\nquoted market prices to the extent available or alternative pricing sources and models utilizing market observable \\ninputs to determine fair value. For certain marketable debt securities, we have elected the fair value option for which \\nchanges in fair value are recorded in OI&E.

The carrying value of our non-marketable equity securities is adjusted to fair value upon observable \\ntransactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer or impairment. Non-marketable equity securities \\nthat have been remeasured during the period based on observable transactions are classified within Level 2 or Level 3 \\nin the fair value hierarchy because we estimate the value based on valuation methods, including option pricing models, \\nmarket comparable approach, and common stock equivalent method, which may include a combination of the \\nobservable transaction price at the transaction date and other unobservable inputs including volatility, expected time to \\nexit, risk free rate, and the rights, and obligations of the securities we hold. These inputs significantly vary based on \\ninvestment type. The fair value of non-marketable equity securities that have been remeasured due to impairment are \\nclassified within Level 3.\\nAs of December 31, 2023, the carrying value of our non-marketable equity securities was $28.8 billion, of which \\n$13.7 billion were remeasured at fair value during the year ended December 31, 2023, and primarily classified within \\nLevel 2 of the fair value hierarchy at the time of measurement. \\nTable of Contents\\nAlphabet Inc.\\n65.  \\nDebt Securities\\nThe following table summarizes the estimated fair value of investments in available-for-sale marketable debt \\nsecurities by effective contractual maturity dates (in millions):\\nAs of December 31, \\n2023\\nDue in one year or less\\n$ \\n11,231 \\nDue in one year through five years\\n \\n41,477 \\nDue in five years through 10 years\\n \\n15,351 \\nDue after 10 years\\n \\n14,216 \\nTotal\\n$ \\n82,275 \\nThe following tables present fair values and gross unrealized losses recorded to AOCI, aggregated by \\ninvestment category and the length of time that individual securities have been in a continuous loss position (in \\nmillions):\\n \\nAs of December 31, 2022\\n \\nLess than 12 Months\\n12 Months or Greater\\nTotal\\n \\nFair Value\\nUnrealized\\nLoss\\nFair Value\\nUnrealized\\nLoss\\nFair Value\\nUnrealized\\nLoss\\nGovernment bonds\\n$ \\n21,039 $ \\n(1,004) $ \\n13,438 $ \\n(1,041) $ \\n34,477 $ \\n(2,045) \\nCorporate debt securities\\n \\n11,228  \\n(440)  \\n15,125  \\n(1,052)  \\n26,353  \\n(1,492) \\nMortgage-backed and asset-backed \\nsecurities\\n \\n7,725  \\n(585)  \\n6,964  \\n(657)  \\n14,689  \\n(1,242) \\nTotal\\n$ \\n39,992 $ \\n(2,029) $ \\n35,527 $ \\n(2,750) $ \\n75,519 $ \\n(4,779) \\n \\nAs of December 31, 2023\\n \\nLess than 12 Months\\n12 Months or Greater\\nTotal\\n \\nFair Value\\nUnrealized\\nLoss\\nFair Value\\nUnrealized\\nLoss\\nFair Value\\nUnrealized\\nLoss\\nGovernment bonds\\n$ \\n1,456 $ \\n(22) $ \\n13,897 $ \\n(657) $ \\n15,353 $ \\n(679) \\nCorporate debt securities\\n \\n827  \\n(5)  \\n15,367  \\n(592)  \\n16,194  \\n(597) \\nMortgage-backed and asset-backed \\nsecurities\\n \\n2,945  \\n(26)  \\n7,916  \\n(608)  \\n10,861  \\n(634) \\nTotal\\n$ \\n5,228 $ \\n(53) $ \\n37,180 $ \\n(1,857) $ \\n42,408 $ \\n(1,910) \\nWe determine realized gains or losses on the sale or extinguishment of debt securities on a specific identification \\nmethod.The following table summarizes gains and losses for debt securities, reflected as a component of OI&E (in \\nmillions): \\nYear Ended December 31,\\n \\n2021\\n2022\\n2023\\nUnrealized gain (loss) on fair value option debt securities\\n$ \\n(122) $ \\n(557) $ \\n386 \\nGross realized gain on debt securities\\n \\n432  \\n103  \\n182 \\nGross realized loss on debt securities\\n \\n(329)  \\n(1,588)  \\n(1,833) \\n(Increase) decrease in allowance for credit losses\\n \\n(91)  \\n(22)  \\n50 \\nTotal gain (loss) on debt securities recognized in other income \\n(expense), net\\n$ \\n(110) $ \\n(2,064) $ \\n(1,215) \\nTable of Contents\\nAlphabet Inc.\\n66.  \\nEquity Investments\\nThe carrying value of equity securities is measured as the total initial cost plus the cumulative net gain (loss). \\nGains and losses, including impairments, are included as a component of OI&E in the Consolidated Statements of \\nIncome.

The primary risk \\nmanaged is foreign exchange risk. We use foreign currency contracts to reduce the risk that our cash flows, earnings, \\nand investment in foreign subsidiaries will be adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. We \\nalso enter into derivative instruments to partially offset our exposure to other risks and enhance investment returns.\\nWe recognize derivative instruments in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value and classify the derivatives \\nprimarily within Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. We present our collar contracts (an option strategy comprised of a \\ncombination of purchased and written options) at net fair values and present all other derivatives at gross fair values. \\nThe accounting treatment for derivatives is based on the intended use and hedge designation.\\nCash Flow Hedges\\nWe designate foreign currency forward and option contracts (including collars) as cash flow hedges to hedge \\ncertain forecasted revenue transactions denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. These contracts have \\nmaturities of 24 months or less.\\nCash flow hedge amounts included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness are deferred in AOCI and \\nsubsequently reclassified to revenue when the hedged item is recognized in earnings. We exclude forward points and \\ntime value from our assessment of hedge effectiveness and amortize them on a straight-line basis over the life of the \\nhedging instrument in revenues. The difference between fair value changes of the excluded component and the \\namount amortized to revenues is recorded in AOCI.\\nAs of December 31, 2023, the net accumulated gain on our foreign currency cash flow hedges before tax effect \\nwas $47 million, which is expected to be reclassified from AOCI into revenues within the next 12 months.\\nFair Value Hedges\\nWe designate foreign currency forward contracts as fair value hedges to hedge foreign currency risks for our \\nmarketable securities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Fair value hedge amounts included in the \\nassessment of hedge effectiveness are recognized in OI&E, along with the offsetting gains and losses of the related \\nhedged items. We exclude forward points from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and recognize changes in the \\nexcluded component in OI&E.\\nNet Investment Hedges\\nWe designate foreign currency forward contracts as net investment hedges to hedge the foreign currency risks \\nrelated to our investment in foreign subsidiaries. Net investment hedge amounts included in the assessment of hedge \\neffectiveness are recognized in AOCI along with the foreign currency translation adjustment. We exclude forward \\npoints from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and recognize changes in the excluded component in OI&E.\\nOther Derivatives\\nWe enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts that are not designated as hedging instruments to \\nhedge intercompany transactions and other monetary assets or liabilities denominated in currencies other than the \\nfunctional currency of a subsidiary. Gains and losses on these derivatives that are not designated as accounting \\nhedges are primarily recorded in OI&E along with the foreign currency gains and losses on monetary assets and \\nliabilities.\\nWe also use derivatives not designated as hedging instruments to manage risks relating to interest rates, \\ncommodity prices, credit exposures, and to enhance investment returns. From time to time, we enter into derivatives to \\nhedge the market price risk on certain of our marketable equity securities. Gains and losses arising from other \\nderivatives are primarily reflected within the “other” component of OI&E.

Net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests \\nwas not material for any period presented and is included within the \"other\" component of OI&E. See Note 7 for further \\ndetails on OI&E.\\nUnconsolidated Variable Interest Entities\\nWe have investments in VIEs in which we are not the primary beneficiary. These VIEs include private companies \\nthat are primarily early stage companies and certain renewable energy entities in which activities involve power \\ngeneration using renewable sources.\\nWe have determined that the governance structures of these entities do not allow us to direct the activities that \\nwould significantly affect their economic performance. Therefore, we are not the primary beneficiary, and the results of \\noperations and financial position of these VIEs are not included in our consolidated financial statements. We account \\nfor these investments primarily as non-marketable equity securities or equity method investments.\\nThe maximum exposure of these unconsolidated VIEs is generally based on the current carrying value of the \\ninvestments and any future funding commitments. The maximum exposure and carrying value of these unconsolidated \\nVIEs were $2.8 billion and $2.7 billion, respectively, as of December 31, 2022 and $5.7 billion and $4.0 billion, \\nrespectively, as of December 31, 2023. The difference between the maximum exposure and the carrying value relates \\nprimarily to future funding commitments.\\nNote 6.

We have agreed \\nto defend and/or hold certain parties harmless against losses arising from a breach of representations or covenants, or \\nout of intellectual property infringement or other claims made against certain parties. Several of these agreements limit \\nthe time within which an indemnification claim can be made and the amount of the claim. In addition, we have entered \\ninto indemnification agreements with our officers and directors, and our bylaws contain similar indemnification \\nobligations to our agents.\\nIt is not possible to make a reasonable estimate of the maximum potential amount under these indemnification \\nagreements due to the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement. Additionally, the \\npayments we have made under such agreements have not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations, \\ncash flows, or financial position. However, to the extent that valid indemnification claims arise in the future, future \\npayments by us could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flows \\nin a particular period. \\nAs of December 31, 2023, we did not have any material indemnification claims that were probable or reasonably \\npossible.\\nLegal Matters\\nWe record a liability when we believe that it is probable that a loss has been incurred, and the amount can be \\nreasonably estimated. If we determine that a loss is reasonably possible and the loss or range of loss can be \\nestimated, we disclose the reasonably possible loss. We evaluate developments in our legal matters that could affect \\nthe amount of liability that has been previously accrued, and the matters and related reasonably possible losses \\ndisclosed, and make adjustments as appropriate.\\nCertain outstanding matters seek speculative, substantial or indeterminate monetary amounts, substantial \\nchanges to our business practices and products, or structural remedies. Significant judgment is required to determine \\nboth the likelihood of there being a loss and the estimated amount of a loss related to such matters, and we may be \\nunable to estimate the reasonably possible loss or range of losses. The outcomes of outstanding legal matters are \\ninherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties, and could, either individually or in aggregate, have a \\nmaterial adverse effect.\\nWe expense legal fees in the period in which they are incurred.\\nTable of Contents\\nAlphabet Inc.\\n77.  \\nAntitrust Investigations\\nOn November 30, 2010, the EC\\'s Directorate General for Competition opened an investigation into various \\nantitrust-related complaints against us.\\nOn June 27, 2017, the EC announced its decision that certain actions taken by Google regarding its display and \\nranking of shopping search results and ads infringed European competition law. The EC decision imposed a €2.4 \\nbillion ($2.7 billion as of June 27, 2017) fine. On September 11, 2017, we appealed the EC decision to the General \\nCourt, and on September 27, 2017, we implemented product changes to bring shopping ads into compliance with the \\nEC\\'s decision. We recognized a charge of $2.7 billion for the fine in the second quarter of 2017. On November 10, \\n2021, the General Court rejected our appeal, and we subsequently filed an appeal with the European Court of Justice \\non January 20, 2022.\\nOn July 18, 2018, the EC announced its decision that certain provisions in Google’s Android-related distribution \\nagreements infringed European competition law. The EC decision imposed a €4.3 billion ($5.1 billion as of June 30, \\n2018) fine and directed the termination of the conduct at issue. On October 9, 2018, we appealed the EC decision, and \\non October 29, 2018, we implemented changes to certain of our Android distribution practices. On September 14, \\n2022, the General Court reduced the fine from €4.3 billion to €4.1 billion. We subsequently filed an appeal with the \\nEuropean Court of Justice. In 2018, we recognized a charge of $5.1 billion for the fine, which we reduced by \\n$217 million in 2022.\\nOn March 20, 2019, the EC announced its decision that certain contractual provisions in agreements that Google \\nhad with AdSense for Search partners infringed European competition law. The EC decision imposed a fine of €1.5 \\nbillion ($1.7 billion as of March 20, 2019) and directed actions related to AdSense for Search partners\\' agreements, \\nwhich we implemented prior to the decision. On June 4, 2019, we appealed the EC decision. We recognized a charge \\nof $1.7 billion for the fine in the first quarter of 2019.\\nFrom time to time we are subject to formal and informal inquiries and investigations on various competition \\nmatters by regulatory authorities in the U.S., Europe, and other jurisdictions globally. Examples, for which given their \\nnature we cannot estimate a possible loss, include:\\n•\\nIn August 2019, we began receiving civil investigative demands from the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) \\nrequesting information and documents relating to our prior antitrust investigations and certain aspects of our \\nbusiness. The DOJ and a number of state Attorneys General filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the \\nDistrict of Columbia on October 20, 2020 alleging that Google violated U.S. antitrust laws relating to Search \\nand Search advertising. The trial ended on November 16, 2023, and we expect a decision in 2024. Further, in \\nJune 2022, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) and the United Kingdom\\'s \\nCompetition and Markets Authority (CMA) each opened an investigation into Search distribution practices.\\n•\\nOn December 16, 2020, a number of state Attorneys General filed an antitrust complaint in the U.S. District \\nCourt for the Eastern District of Texas, alleging that Google violated U.S. antitrust laws as well as state \\ndeceptive trade laws relating to its advertising technology, and a trial is scheduled for March 2025. Additionally, \\non January 24, 2023, the DOJ, along with a number of state Attorneys General, filed an antitrust complaint in \\nthe U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia alleging that Google’s digital advertising technology \\nproducts violate U.S. antitrust laws, and on April 17, 2023, a number of additional state Attorneys General \\njoined the complaint. The EC, the CMA, and the ACCC each opened a formal investigation into Google\\'s \\nadvertising technology business practices on June 22, 2021, May 25, 2022, and June 29, 2022, respectively. \\nOn June 14, 2023, the EC issued a Statement of Objections (SO) informing Google of its preliminary view that \\nGoogle violated European antitrust laws relating to its advertising technology. We responded to the SO on \\nDecember 1, 2023.\\n•\\nOn July 7, 2021, a number of state Attorneys General filed an antitrust complaint in the U.S. District Court for \\nthe Northern District of California, alleging that Google’s operation of Android and Google Play violated U.S. \\nantitrust laws and state antitrust and consumer protection laws. In September 2023, we reached a settlement \\nin principle with 50 state Attorneys General and three territories. The U.S. District Court subsequently vacated \\nthe trial date with the states, and any final approval of the settlement is expected to occur in 2024. In May \\n2022, the EC and the CMA each opened investigations into Google Play’s business practices. Korean \\nregulators are investigating Google Play\\'s billing practices, including a formal review in May 2022 of Google\\'s \\ncompliance with the new app store billing regulations. \\nWe believe we have strong arguments against these claims and will defend ourselves vigorously. We continue to \\ncooperate with federal and state regulators in the U.S., the EC, and other regulators around the world.\\nTable of Contents\\nAlphabet Inc.\\n78.  \\nPrivacy Matters \\nWe are subject to a number of privacy-related laws and regulations, and we currently are party to a number of \\nprivacy investigations and lawsuits ongoing in multiple jurisdictions. For example, there are ongoing investigations and \\nlitigation in the U.S. and the EU, including those relating to our collection and use of location information and \\nadvertising practices, which could result in significant fines, judgments, and product changes. \\nPatent and Intellectual Property Claims\\nWe have had patent, copyright, trade secret, and trademark infringement lawsuits filed against us claiming that \\ncertain of our products, services, and technologies infringe others\\' intellectual property rights. Adverse results in these \\nlawsuits may include awards of substantial monetary damages, costly royalty or licensing agreements, or orders \\npreventing us from offering certain features, functionalities, products, or services. As a result, we may have to change \\nour business practices and develop non-infringing products or technologies, which could result in a loss of revenues for \\nus and otherwise harm our business. In addition, the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) has increasingly \\nbecome an important forum to litigate intellectual property disputes because an ultimate loss in an ITC action can \\nresult in a prohibition on importing infringing products into the U.S. Because the U.S. is an important market, a \\nprohibition on importation could have an adverse effect on us, including preventing us from importing many important \\nproducts into the U.S. or necessitating workarounds that may limit certain features of our products.\\nFurthermore, many of our agreements with our customers and partners require us to indemnify them against \\ncertain intellectual property infringement claims, which would increase our costs as a result of defending such claims, \\nand may require that we pay significant damages if there were an adverse ruling in any such claims. In addition, our \\ncustomers and partners may discontinue the use of our products, services, and technologies, as a result of injunctions \\nor otherwise, which could result in loss of revenues and adversely affect our business.\\nOther\\nWe are subject to claims, lawsuits, regulatory and government investigations, other proceedings, and consent \\norders involving competition, intellectual property, data security, tax and related compliance, labor and employment, \\ncommercial disputes, content generated by our users, goods and services offered by advertisers or publishers using \\nour platforms, personal injury, consumer protection, and other matters. For example, in December 2023, a California \\njury delivered a verdict in Epic Games v. Google finding that Google violated antitrust laws related to Google Play\\'s \\nbusiness. The presiding judge will determine remedies in 2024, and the range of potential remedies vary widely. We \\nplan to appeal. We also periodically have data incidents that we report to relevant regulators as required by law. \\nThese claims, consent orders, lawsuits, regulatory and government investigations, and other proceedings could \\nresult in substantial fines and penalties, injunctive relief, ongoing monitoring and auditing obligations, changes to our \\nproducts and services, alterations to our business models and operations, and collateral related civil litigation or other \\nadverse consequences, all of which could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results.\\nWe have ongoing legal matters relating to Russia. For example, civil judgments that include compounding \\npenalties have been imposed upon us in connection with disputes regarding the termination of accounts, including \\nthose of sanctioned parties. We do not believe these ongoing legal matters will have a material adverse effect.\\nNon-Income Taxes\\nWe are under audit by various domestic and foreign tax authorities with regards to non-income tax matters. The \\nsubject matter of non-income tax audits primarily arises from disputes on the tax treatment and tax rate applied to the \\nsale of our products and services in these jurisdictions and the tax treatment of certain employee benefits. We accrue \\nnon-income taxes that may result from examinations by, or any negotiated agreements with, these tax authorities when \\na loss is probable and reasonably estimable. If we determine that a loss is reasonably possible and the loss or range of \\nloss can be estimated, we disclose the reasonably possible loss. Due to the inherent complexity and uncertainty of \\nthese matters and judicial process in certain jurisdictions, the final outcome may be materially different from our \\nexpectations.\\nSee, Note 14 for information regarding income tax contingencies.\\nTable of Contents\\nAlphabet Inc.\\n79.  \\nNote 11.        Stockholders\\' Equity \\nClass A and Class B Common Stock and Class C Capital Stock\\nOur Board of Directors has authorized three classes of stock, Class A and Class B common stock, and Class C \\ncapital stock. The rights of the holders of each class of our common and capital stock are identical, except with respect \\nto voting. Each share of Class A common stock is entitled to one vote per share. Each share of Class B common stock \\nis entitled to 10 votes per share.

As of December 31, 2023, $36.3 billion remains available for Class A \\nand Class C share repurchases. \\nThe following table presents Class A and Class C shares repurchased and subsequently retired (in millions):\\nYear Ended December 31, 2022\\nYear Ended December 31, 2023\\nShares\\nAmount\\nShares\\nAmount\\nClass A share repurchases\\n61\\n$ \\n6,719 \\n78\\n$ \\n9,316 \\nClass C share repurchases\\n469\\n \\n52,577 \\n450\\n \\n52,868 \\nTotal share repurchases(1)\\n530\\n$ \\n59,296 \\n528\\n$ \\n62,184 \\n(1)         Shares repurchased include unsettled repurchases as of December 31, 2023.\\nClass A and Class C shares are repurchased in a manner deemed in the best interest of the company and its \\nstockholders, taking into account the economic cost and prevailing market conditions, including the relative trading \\nprices and volumes of the Class A and Class C shares. Repurchases are executed from time to time, subject to \\ngeneral business and market conditions and other investment opportunities, through open market purchases or \\nprivately negotiated transactions, including through Rule 10b5-1 plans. The repurchase program does not have an \\nexpiration date.\\nNote 12.        Net Income Per Share \\nWe compute net income per share of Class A, Class B, and Class C stock using the two-class method. Basic net \\nincome per share is computed using the weighted-average number of shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net \\nincome per share is computed using the weighted-average number of shares and the effect of potentially dilutive \\nsecurities outstanding during the period. Potentially dilutive securities consist of RSUs and other contingently issuable \\nshares. The dilutive effect of outstanding RSUs and other contingently issuable shares is reflected in diluted earnings \\nper share by application of the treasury stock method. The computation of the diluted net income per share of Class A \\nstock assumes the conversion of Class B stock, while the diluted net income per share of Class B stock does not \\nassume the conversion of those shares.\\nThe rights, including the liquidation and dividend rights, of the holders of our Class A, Class B, and Class C stock \\nare identical, except with respect to voting. Furthermore, there are a number of safeguards built into our certificate of \\nincorporation, as well as Delaware law, which preclude our Board of Directors from declaring or paying unequal per \\nshare dividends on our Class A, Class B, and Class C stock. Specifically, Delaware law provides that amendments to \\nour certificate of incorporation which would have the effect of adversely altering the rights, powers, or preferences of a \\ngiven class of stock must be approved by the class of stock adversely affected by the proposed amendment. In \\naddition, our certificate of incorporation provides that before any such amendment may be put to a stockholder vote, it \\nmust be approved by the unanimous consent of our Board of Directors. As a result, the undistributed earnings for each \\nyear are allocated based on the contractual participation rights of the Class A, Class B, and Class C stock as if the \\nearnings for the year had been distributed. As the liquidation and dividend rights are identical, the undistributed \\nearnings are allocated on a proportionate basis. \\nIn the years ended December 31, 2021, 2022, and 2023, the net income per share amounts are the same for \\nClass A, Class B, and Class C stock because the holders of each class are entitled to equal per share dividends or \\ndistributions in liquidation in accordance with the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation of Alphabet Inc.\\nTable of Contents\\nAlphabet Inc.\\n80.  \\nThe following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted net income per share of Class A, Class B, and \\nClass C stock (in millions, except per share amounts):\\n \\nYear Ended December 31,\\n \\n2021\\n \\nClass A\\nClass B\\nClass C\\nBasic net income per share:\\nNumerator\\nAllocation of undistributed earnings \\n$ \\n34,200 \\n$ \\n5,174 \\n$ \\n36,659 \\nDenominator\\nNumber of shares used in per share computation\\n \\n6,006 \\n \\n909 \\n \\n6,438 \\nBasic net income per share\\n$ \\n5.69 \\n$ \\n5.69 \\n$ \\n5.69 \\nDiluted net income per share:\\nNumerator\\nAllocation of undistributed earnings for basic computation \\n$ \\n34,200 \\n$ \\n5,174 \\n$ \\n36,659 \\nReallocation of undistributed earnings as a result of conversion of Class B to Class A \\nshares\\n \\n5,174 \\n \\n0 \\n \\n0 \\nReallocation of undistributed earnings\\n \\n(581)  \\n(77)  \\n581 \\nAllocation of undistributed earnings\\n$ \\n38,793 \\n$ \\n5,097 \\n$ \\n37,240 \\nDenominator\\nNumber of shares used in basic computation\\n \\n6,006 \\n \\n909 \\n \\n6,438 \\nWeighted-average effect of dilutive securities\\nAdd:\\nConversion of Class B to Class A shares outstanding\\n \\n909 \\n \\n0 \\n \\n0 \\nRestricted stock units and other contingently issuable shares\\n \\n0 \\n \\n0 \\n \\n200 \\nNumber of shares used in per share computation\\n \\n6,915 \\n \\n909 \\n \\n6,638 \\nDiluted net income per share\\n$ \\n5.61 \\n$ \\n5.61 \\n$ \\n5.61 \\n \\nYear Ended December 31,\\n \\n2022\\n \\nClass A\\nClass B\\nClass C\\nBasic net income per share:\\nNumerator\\nAllocation of undistributed earnings\\n$ \\n27,518 \\n$ \\n4,072 \\n$ \\n28,382 \\nDenominator\\nNumber of shares used in per share computation\\n \\n5,994 \\n \\n887 \\n \\n6,182 \\nBasic net income per share\\n$ \\n4.59 \\n$ \\n4.59 \\n$ \\n4.59 \\nDiluted net income per share:\\nNumerator\\nAllocation of undistributed earnings for basic computation \\n$ \\n27,518 \\n$ \\n4,072 \\n$ \\n28,382 \\nReallocation of undistributed earnings as a result of conversion of Class B to Class A \\nshares\\n \\n4,072 \\n \\n0 \\n \\n0 \\nReallocation of undistributed earnings\\n \\n(230)  \\n(30)  \\n230 \\nAllocation of undistributed earnings\\n$ \\n31,360 \\n$ \\n4,042 \\n$ \\n28,612 \\nDenominator\\nNumber of shares used in basic computation\\n \\n5,994 \\n \\n887 \\n \\n6,182 \\nWeighted-average effect of dilutive securities\\nAdd:\\nConversion of Class B to Class A shares outstanding\\n \\n887 \\n \\n0 \\n \\n0 \\nRestricted stock units and other contingently issuable shares\\n \\n0 \\n \\n0 \\n \\n96 \\nNumber of shares used in per share computation\\n \\n6,881 \\n \\n887 \\n \\n6,278 \\nDiluted net income per share\\n$ \\n4.56 \\n$ \\n4.56 \\n$ \\n4.56 \\nTable of Contents\\nAlphabet Inc.\\n81.  \\n \\nYear Ended December 31,\\n \\n2023\\n \\nClass A\\nClass B\\nClass C\\nBasic net income per share:\\nNumerator\\nAllocation of undistributed earnings\\n$ \\n34,601 \\n$ \\n5,124 \\n$ \\n34,070 \\nDenominator\\nNumber of shares used in per share computation\\n \\n5,922 \\n \\n877 \\n \\n5,831 \\nBasic net income per share\\n$ \\n5.84 \\n$ \\n5.84 \\n$ \\n5.84 \\nDiluted net income per share:\\nNumerator\\nAllocation of undistributed earnings for basic computation \\n$ \\n34,601 \\n$ \\n5,124 \\n$ \\n34,070 \\nReallocation of undistributed earnings as a result of conversion of Class B to Class A \\nshares\\n \\n5,124 \\n \\n0 \\n \\n0 \\nReallocation of undistributed earnings\\n \\n(287)  \\n(37)  \\n287 \\nAllocation of undistributed earnings\\n$ \\n39,438 \\n$ \\n5,087 \\n$ \\n34,357 \\nDenominator\\nNumber of shares used in basic computation\\n \\n5,922 \\n \\n877 \\n \\n5,831 \\nWeighted-average effect of dilutive securities\\nAdd:\\nConversion of Class B to Class A shares outstanding\\n \\n877 \\n \\n0 \\n \\n0 \\nRestricted stock units and other contingently issuable shares\\n \\n0 \\n \\n0 \\n \\n92 \\nNumber of shares used in per share computation\\n \\n6,799 \\n \\n877 \\n \\n5,923 \\nDiluted net income per share\\n$ \\n5.80 \\n$ \\n5.80 \\n$ \\n5.80 \\nNote 13.

Significant judgment is required in evaluating \\nour uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes. The total amount of gross unrecognized tax \\nbenefits was $5.2 billion, $7.1 billion, and $9.4 billion as of December 31, 2021, 2022, and 2023, respectively, of which \\n$3.7 billion, $5.3 billion, and $7.4 billion, if recognized, would affect our effective tax rate, respectively. \\nAs of December 31, 2022 and 2023, we accrued $346 million and $622 million in interest and penalties in \\nprovision for income taxes, respectively.\\nWe file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and in many state and foreign jurisdictions. Our two \\nmajor tax jurisdictions are the U.S. federal and Ireland. We are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax \\nreturns by the IRS and other tax authorities. The IRS is currently examining our 2016 through 2021 tax returns. We \\nhave also received tax assessments in multiple foreign jurisdictions asserting transfer pricing adjustments or \\npermanent establishment. We continue to defend such claims as presented.\\nThe tax years 2016 through 2022 remain subject to examination by the appropriate governmental agencies for \\nIrish tax purposes. There are other ongoing audits in various other jurisdictions that are not material to our financial \\nstatements.\\nWe regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the \\nadequacy of our provision for income taxes. We continue to monitor the progress of ongoing discussions with tax \\nauthorities and the effect, if any, of the expected expiration of the statute of limitations in various taxing jurisdictions.\\nWe believe that an adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations. \\nHowever, the outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty. If any issues addressed in our tax audits are \\nresolved in a manner not consistent with management\\'s expectations, we could be required to adjust our provision for \\nincome taxes in the period such resolutions occur. Although the timing of resolution, settlement, and closure of audits is \\nnot certain, it is reasonably possible that our unrecognized tax benefits from certain U.S. federal, state, and non U.S. \\ntax positions could decrease by approximately $700 million in the next 12 months. Positions that may be resolved \\ninclude various U.S. and non-U.S. matters.\\nTable of Contents\\nAlphabet Inc.\\n85.  \\nNote 15.

Management reviewed the results of its assessment with our Audit and Compliance Committee. \\nThe effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023 has been audited by Ernst & \\nYoung LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in its report which is included in Item 8 of this \\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K.\\nLimitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures\\nIn designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls \\nand procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the \\ndesired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there \\nare resource constraints and that management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible \\ncontrols and procedures relative to their costs.\\nTable of Contents\\nAlphabet Inc.\\n88.  \\nITEM 9B.\\nOTHER INFORMATION\\n10b5-1 Trading Plans\\nDuring the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2023, the following Section 16 officer and directors adopted, \\nmodified or terminated a “Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement” (as defined in Item 408 of Regulation S-K of the Exchange \\nAct):\\n•\\nJohn Hennessy, Chair of the Board of Directors, through the John L.

BUSINESS\\nOverview\\nWe design, develop, manufacture, sell and lease high-performance fully electric vehicles and energy generation and storage systems, and offer\\nservices related to our products. We generally sell our products directly to customers, and continue to grow our customer-facing infrastructure through a\\nglobal network of vehicle showrooms and service centers, Mobile Service, body shops, Supercharger stations and Destination Chargers to accelerate the\\nwidespread adoption of our products. We emphasize performance, attractive styling and the safety of our users and workforce in the design and\\nmanufacture of our products and are continuing to develop full self-driving technology for improved safety. We also strive to lower the cost of ownership\\nfor our customers through continuous efforts to reduce manufacturing costs and by offering financial and other services tailored to our products.\\nOur mission is to accelerate the world’s transition to sustainable energy. We believe that this mission, along with our engineering expertise,\\nvertically integrated business model and focus on user experience differentiate us from other companies.\\nSegment Information\\nWe operate as two reportable segments: (i) automotive and (ii) energy generation and storage.\\nThe automotive segment includes the design, development, manufacturing, sales and leasing of high-performance fully electric vehicles as well as\\nsales of automotive regulatory credits. Additionally, the automotive segment also includes services and other, which includes sales of used vehicles, non-\\nwarranty after-sales vehicle services, body shop and parts, paid Supercharging, vehicle insurance revenue and retail merchandise. The energy generation\\nand storage segment includes the design, manufacture, installation, sales and leasing of solar energy generation and energy storage products and related\\nservices and sales of solar energy systems incentives.\\nOur Products and Services\\nAutomotive\\nWe currently manufacture five different consumer vehicles – the Model 3, Y, S, X and Cybertruck. Model 3 is a four-door mid-size sedan that we\\ndesigned for manufacturability with a base price for mass-market appeal. Model Y is a compact sport utility vehicle (“SUV”) built on the Model 3 platform\\nwith seating for up to seven adults. Model S is a four-door full-size sedan and Model X is a mid-size SUV with seating for up to seven adults. Model S and\\nModel X feature the highest performance characteristics and longest ranges that we offer in a sedan and SUV, respectively. In November 2023, we\\nentered the consumer pickup truck market with first deliveries of the Cybertruck, a full-size electric pickup truck with a stainless steel exterior that has\\nthe utility and strength of a truck while featuring the speed of a sports car.\\nIn 2022, we also began early production and deliveries of a commercial electric vehicle, the Tesla Semi. We have planned electric vehicles to\\naddress additional vehicle markets, and to continue leveraging developments in our proprietary Full Self-Driving (“FSD”) Capability features, battery cell\\nand other technologies.\\nEnergy Generation and Storage\\nEnergy Storage Products\\nPowerwall and Megapack are our lithium-ion battery energy storage products. Powerwall, which we sell directly to customers, as well as through\\nchannel partners, is designed to store energy at a home or small commercial facility. Megapack is an energy storage solution for commercial, industrial,\\nutility and energy generation customers, multiple of which may be grouped together to form larger installations of gigawatt hours (“GWh”) or greater\\ncapacity.\\nWe also continue to develop software capabilities for remotely controlling and dispatching our energy storage systems across a wide range of\\nmarkets and applications, including through our real-time energy control and optimization platforms.\\n4\\nTable of Contents\\nSolar Energy Offerings\\nWe sell retrofit solar energy systems to customers and channel partners and also make them available through power purchase agreement (“PPA”)\\narrangements. We purchase most of the components for our retrofit solar energy systems from multiple sources to ensure competitive pricing and\\nadequate supply. We also design and manufacture certain components for our solar energy products.\\nWe sell our Solar Roof, which combines premium glass roof tiles with energy generation, directly to customers, as well as through channel\\ncustomers. We continue to improve our installation capability and efficiency, including through collaboration with real estate developers and builders on\\nnew homes.\\nTechnology\\nAutomotive\\nBattery and Powertrain\\nOur core vehicle technology competencies include powertrain engineering and manufacturing and our ability to design vehicles that utilize the\\nunique advantages of an electric powertrain. We have designed our proprietary powertrain systems to be adaptable, efficient, reliable and cost-effective\\nwhile withstanding the rigors of an automotive environment. We offer dual motor powertrain vehicles, which use two electric motors to maximize traction\\nand performance in an all-wheel drive configuration, as well as vehicle powertrain technology featuring three electric motors for further increased\\nperformance in certain versions of Model S and Model X, Cybertruck and the Tesla Semi.\\nWe maintain extensive testing and R&D capabilities for battery cells, packs and systems, and have built an expansive body of knowledge on lithium-\\nion cell chemistry types and performance characteristics. In order to enable a greater supply of cells for our products with higher energy density at lower\\ncosts, we have developed a new proprietary lithium-ion battery cell and improved manufacturing processes.\\nVehicle Control and Infotainment Software\\nThe performance and safety systems of our vehicles and their battery packs utilize sophisticated control software. Control systems in our vehicles\\noptimize performance, customize vehicle behavior, manage charging and control all infotainment functions. We develop almost all of this software,\\nincluding most of the user interfaces, internally and update our vehicles’ software regularly through over-the-air updates.\\nSelf-Driving Development and Artificial Intelligence\\nWe have expertise in developing technologies, systems and software to enable self-driving vehicles using primarily vision-based technologies. Our\\nFSD Computer runs our neural networks in our vehicles, and we are also developing additional computer hardware to better enable the massive amounts\\nof field data captured by our vehicles to continually train and improve these neural networks for real-world performance.\\nCurrently, we offer in our vehicles certain advanced driver assist systems under our Autopilot and FSD Capability options. Although at present the\\ndriver is ultimately responsible for controlling the vehicle, our systems provide safety and convenience functionality that relieves drivers of the most\\ntedious and potentially dangerous aspects of road travel much like the system that airplane pilots use, when conditions permit. As with other vehicle\\nsystems, we improve these functions in our vehicles over time through over-the-air updates.\\nWe intend to establish in the future an autonomous Tesla ride-hailing network, which we expect would also allow us to access a new customer base\\neven as modes of transportation evolve.\\nWe are also applying our artificial intelligence learnings from self-driving technology to the field of robotics, such as through Optimus, a robotic\\nhumanoid in development, which is controlled by the same AI system.\\n5\\nTable of Contents\\nEnergy Generation and Storage\\nEnergy Storage Products\\nWe leverage many of the component-level technologies from our vehicles in our energy storage products. By taking a modular approach to the\\ndesign of battery systems, we can optimize manufacturing capacity of our energy storage products. Additionally, our expertise in power electronics\\nenables our battery systems to interconnect with electricity grids while providing fast-acting systems for power injection and absorption. We have also\\ndeveloped software to remotely control and dispatch our energy storage systems.\\nSolar Energy Systems\\nWe have engineered Solar Roof over numerous iterations to combine aesthetic appeal and durability with power generation. The efficiency of our\\nsolar energy products is aided by our own solar inverter, which incorporates our power electronics technologies. We designed both products to integrate\\nwith Powerwall.\\nDesign and Engineering\\nAutomotive\\nWe have established significant in-house capabilities in the design and test engineering of electric vehicles and their components and systems. Our\\nteam has significant experience in computer-aided design as well as durability, strength and crash test simulations, which reduces the product\\ndevelopment time of new models. We have also achieved complex engineering feats in stamping, casting and thermal systems, and developed a method\\nto integrate batteries directly with vehicle body structures without separate battery packs to optimize manufacturability, weight, range and cost\\ncharacteristics.\\nWe are also expanding our manufacturing operations globally while taking action to localize our vehicle designs and production for particular\\nmarkets, including country-specific market demands and factory optimizations for local workforces. As we increase our capabilities, particularly in the\\nareas of automation, die-making and line-building, we are also making strides in the simulations modeling these capabilities prior to construction.\\nEnergy Generation and Storage\\nOur expertise in electrical, mechanical, civil and software engineering allows us to design, engineer, manufacture and install energy generating and\\nstorage products and components, including at the residential through utility scale. For example, the modular design of our Megapack utility-scale battery\\nline is intended to significantly reduce the amount of assembly required in the field. We also customize solutions including our energy storage products,\\nsolar energy systems and/or Solar Roof for customers to meet their specific needs.\\nSales and Marketing\\nHistorically, we have been able to achieve sales without traditional advertising and at relatively low marketing costs. We continue to monitor our\\npublic narrative and brand, and tailor our marketing efforts accordingly, including through investments in customer education and advertising as\\nnecessary.\\nAutomotive\\nDirect Sales\\nOur vehicle sales channels currently include our website and an international network of company-owned stores. In some jurisdictions, we also have\\ngalleries to educate and inform customers about our products, but such locations do not transact in the sale of vehicles. We believe this infrastructure\\nenables us to better control costs of inventory, manage warranty service and pricing, educate consumers about electric vehicles, make our vehicles more\\naffordable, maintain and strengthen the Tesla brand and obtain rapid customer feedback.\\nWe reevaluate our sales strategy both globally and at a location-by-location level from time to time to optimize our sales channels. However, sales\\nof vehicles in the automobile industry tend to be cyclical in many markets, which may expose us to volatility from time to time.\\n6\\nTable of Contents\\nUsed Vehicle Sales\\nOur used vehicle business supports new vehicle sales by integrating the trade-in of a customer’s existing Tesla or non-Tesla vehicle with the sale of\\na new or used Tesla vehicle. The Tesla and non-Tesla vehicles we acquire as trade-ins are subsequently remarketed, either directly by us or through third\\nparties. We also remarket used Tesla vehicles acquired from other sources including lease returns.\\nPublic Charging\\nWe have a growing global network of Tesla Superchargers, which are our industrial-grade, high-speed vehicle chargers. Where possible, we co-\\nlocate Superchargers with our solar and energy storage systems to reduce costs and promote renewable power. Supercharger stations are typically\\nplaced along well-traveled routes and in and around dense city centers to allow vehicle owners the ability to enjoy quick, reliable charging along an\\nextensive network with convenient stops. Use of the Supercharger network either requires payment of a fee or is free under certain sales programs. In\\nNovember 2021, we began to offer Supercharger access to non-Tesla vehicles in certain locations in support of our mission to accelerate the world’s\\ntransition to sustainable energy, and in November 2022, we opened up our previously proprietary charging connector as the North American Charging\\nStandard (NACS). This enables all electric vehicles and charging stations to interoperate — which makes charging easier and more efficient for everyone\\nand advances our mission to accelerate the world’s transition to sustainable energy. Following this, a number of major automotive companies announced\\ntheir adoption of NACS, with their access to the Supercharger network beginning in phases in 2024 and their production of NACS vehicles beginning no\\nlater than 2025. We also engaged SAE International to govern NACS as an industry standard, now named J3400. We continue to monitor and increase our\\nnetwork of Tesla Superchargers in anticipation of future demand.\\nWe also work with a wide variety of hospitality, retail and public destinations, as well as businesses with commuting employees, to offer additional\\ncharging options for our customers, as well as single-family homeowners and multi-family residential entities, to deploy home charging solutions.\\nIn-App Upgrades\\nAs our vehicles are capable of being updated remotely over-the-air, our customers may purchase additional paid options and features through the\\nTesla app or through the in-vehicle user interface. We expect that this functionality will also allow us to offer certain options and features on a\\nsubscription basis in the future.\\nEnergy Generation and Storage\\nWe market and sell our solar and energy storage products to residential, commercial and industrial customers and utilities through a variety of\\nchannels, including through our website, stores and galleries, as well as through our network of channel partners, and in the case of some commercial\\ncustomers, through PPA transactions. We emphasize simplicity, standardization and accessibility to make it easy and cost-effective for customers to adopt\\nclean energy, while reducing our customer acquisition costs.\\nService and Warranty\\nAutomotive\\nService\\nWe provide service for our electric vehicles at our company-owned service locations and through Tesla Mobile Service technicians who perform work\\nremotely at customers’ homes or other locations. Servicing the vehicles ourselves allows us to identify problems and implement solutions and\\nimprovements faster than traditional automobile manufacturers and their dealer networks. The connectivity of our vehicles also allows us to diagnose and\\nremedy many problems remotely and proactively.\\nVehicle Limited Warranties and Extended Service Plans\\nWe provide a manufacturer’s limited warranty on all new and used Tesla vehicles we sell directly to consumers, which may include limited\\nwarranties on certain components, specific types of damage or battery capacity retention. We also currently offer optional extended service plans that\\nprovide coverage beyond the new vehicle limited warranties for certain models in specified regions.\\n7\\nTable of Contents\\nEnergy Generation and Storage\\nWe provide service and repairs to our energy product customers, including under warranty where applicable. We generally provide manufacturer’s\\nlimited warranties with our energy storage products and offer certain extended limited warranties that are available at the time of purchase of the\\nsystem. If we install a system, we also provide certain limited warranties on our installation workmanship.\\nFor retrofit solar energy systems, we provide separate limited warranties for workmanship and against roof leaks, and for Solar Roof, we also\\nprovide limited warranties for defects and weatherization. For components not manufactured by us, we generally pass-through the applicable\\nmanufacturers’ warranties.\\nAs part of our solar energy system and energy storage contracts, we may provide the customer with performance guarantees that commit that the\\nunderlying system will meet or exceed the minimum energy generation or performance requirements specified in the contract.\\nFinancial Services\\nAutomotive\\nPurchase Financing and Leases\\nWe offer leasing and/or loan financing arrangements for our vehicles in certain jurisdictions in North America, Europe and Asia ourselves and\\nthrough various financial institutions. Under certain of such programs, we have provided resale value guarantees or buyback guarantees that may\\nobligate us to cover a resale loss up to a certain limit or repurchase the subject vehicles at pre-determined values.\\nInsurance\\nIn 2021, we launched our insurance product using real-time driving behavior in select states, which offers rates that are often better than other\\nalternatives and promotes safer driving. Our insurance products are currently available in 12 states and we plan to expand the markets in which we offer\\ninsurance products, as part of our ongoing effort to decrease the total cost of ownership for our customers.\\nEnergy Generation and Storage\\nWe offer certain financing options to our solar customers, which enable the customer to purchase and own a solar energy system, Solar Roof or\\nintegrated solar and Powerwall system. Our solar PPAs, offered primarily to commercial customers, charge a fee per kilowatt-hour based on the amount of\\nelectricity produced by our solar energy systems.\\nManufacturing\\nWe currently have manufacturing facilities in the U.S. in Northern California, in Buffalo, New York, Gigafactory New York; in Austin, Texas,\\nGigafactory Texas and near Reno, Nevada, Gigafactory Nevada. At these facilities, we manufacture and assemble, among other things, vehicles, certain\\nvehicle parts and components, such as our battery packs and battery cells, energy storage components and solar products and components.\\nInternationally, we also have manufacturing facilities in China (Gigafactory Shanghai) and Germany (Gigafactory Berlin-Brandenburg), which allows\\nus to increase the affordability of our vehicles for customers in local markets by reducing transportation and manufacturing costs and eliminating the\\nimpact of unfavorable tariffs. In March 2023, we announced the location of our next Gigafactory in Monterrey, Mexico. Generally, we continue to expand\\nproduction capacity at our existing facilities. We also intend to further increase cost-competitiveness in our significant markets by strategically adding\\nlocal manufacturing.\\nSupply Chain\\nOur products use thousands of parts that are sourced from hundreds of suppliers across the world. We have developed close relationships with\\nvendors of key parts such as battery cells, electronics and complex vehicle assemblies. Certain components purchased from these suppliers are shared or\\nare similar across many product lines, allowing us to take advantage of pricing efficiencies from economies of scale.\\n8\\nTable of Contents\\nAs is the case for some automotive companies, some of our procured components and systems are sourced from single suppliers. Where multiple\\nsources are available for certain key components, we work to qualify multiple suppliers for them where it is sensible to do so in order to minimize\\npotential production risks due to disruptions in their supply. We also mitigate risk by maintaining safety stock for key parts and assemblies and die banks\\nfor components with lengthy procurement lead times.\\nOur products use various raw materials including aluminum, steel, cobalt, lithium, nickel and copper. Pricing for these materials is governed by\\nmarket conditions and may fluctuate due to various factors outside of our control, such as supply and demand and market speculation. We strive to\\nexecute long-term supply contracts for such materials at competitive pricing when feasible, and we currently believe that we have adequate access to\\nraw materials supplies to meet the needs of our operations.\\nGovernmental Programs, Incentives and Regulations\\nGlobally, the ownership of our products by our customers is impacted by various government credits, incentives, and policies. Our business and\\nproducts are also subject to numerous governmental regulations that vary among jurisdictions.\\nThe operation of our business is also impacted by various government programs, incentives, and other arrangements. See Note 2, Summary of\\nSignificant Accounting Policies, to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details.\\nPrograms and Incentives\\nInflation Reduction Act\\nOn August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (“IRA”) was enacted into law and is effective for taxable years beginning after December\\n31, 2022, and remains subject to future guidance releases. The IRA includes multiple incentives to promote clean energy, electric vehicles, battery and\\nenergy storage manufacture or purchase, including through providing tax credits to consumers. For example, qualifying Tesla customers may receive up\\nto $7,500 in federal tax credits for the purchase of qualified electric vehicles in the U.S. through 2032.\\nAutomotive Regulatory Credits\\nWe earn tradable credits in the operation of our business under various regulations related to zero-emission vehicles (“ZEVs”), greenhouse gas, fuel\\neconomy and clean fuel. We sell these credits to other regulated entities who can use the credits to comply with emission standards and other regulatory\\nrequirements. Sales of these credits are recognized within automotive regulatory credits revenue in our consolidated statements of operations included\\nelsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\\nEnergy Storage System Incentives and Policies\\nWhile the regulatory regime for energy storage projects is still under development, there are various policies, incentives and financial mechanisms\\nat the federal, state and local levels that support the adoption of energy storage.\\nFor example, energy storage systems that are charged using solar energy may be eligible for the solar energy-related U.S. federal tax credits\\ndescribed below. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (“FERC”) has also taken steps to enable the participation of energy storage in wholesale\\nenergy markets. In addition, California and a number of other states have adopted procurement targets for energy storage, and behind-the-meter energy\\nstorage systems qualify for funding under the California Self Generation Incentive Program. Our customers primarily benefit directly under these\\nprograms. In certain instances our customers may transfer such credits to us as contract consideration. In such transactions, they are included as a\\ncomponent of energy generation and storage revenues in our consolidated statements of operations included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form\\n10-K.\\nPursuant to the IRA, under Sections 48, 48E and 25D of the Internal Revenue Code (”IRC”), standalone energy storage technology is eligible for a tax\\ncredit between 6% and 50% of qualified expenditures, regardless of the source of energy, which may be claimed by our customers for storage systems\\nthey purchase or by us for arrangements where we own the systems. These tax credits are primarily for the benefit of our customers and are currently\\nscheduled to phase-out starting in 2032 or later.\\n9\\nTable of Contents\\nSolar Energy System Incentives and Policies\\nU.S. federal, state and local governments have established various policies, incentives and financial mechanisms to reduce the cost of solar energy\\nand to accelerate the adoption of solar energy. These incentives include tax credits, cash grants, tax abatements and rebates.\\nIn particular, pursuant to the IRA, Sections 48, 48E and 25D of the IRC provides a tax credit between 6% and 70% of qualified commercial or\\nresidential expenditures for solar energy systems, which may be claimed by our customers for systems they purchase, or by us for arrangements where\\nwe own the systems for properties that meet statutory requirements. These tax credits are primarily for the direct benefit of our customers and are\\ncurrently scheduled to phase-out starting in 2032 or later.\\nRegulations\\nVehicle Safety and Testing\\nIn the U.S., our vehicles are subject to regulation by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (“NHTSA”), including all applicable Federal\\nMotor Vehicle Safety Standards (“FMVSS”) and the NHTSA bumper standard. Numerous FMVSS apply to our vehicles, such as crash-worthiness and\\noccupant protection requirements. Our current vehicles fully comply and we expect that our vehicles in the future will fully comply with all applicable\\nFMVSS with limited or no exemptions, however, FMVSS are subject to change from time to time. As a manufacturer, we must self-certify that our vehicles\\nmeet all applicable FMVSS and the NHTSA bumper standard, or otherwise are exempt, before the vehicles may be imported or sold in the U.S.\\nWe are also required to comply with other federal laws administered by NHTSA, including the Corporate Average Fuel Economy standards, Theft\\nPrevention Act requirements, labeling requirements and other information provided to customers in writing, Early Warning Reporting requirements\\nregarding warranty claims, field reports, death and injury reports and foreign recalls, a Standing General Order requiring reports regarding crashes\\ninvolving vehicles equipped with advanced driver assistance systems, and additional requirements for cooperating with compliance and safety\\ninvestigations and recall reporting. The U.S. Automobile Information and Disclosure Act also requires manufacturers of motor vehicles to disclose certain\\ninformation regarding the manufacturer’s suggested retail price, optional equipment and pricing. In addition, federal law requires inclusion of fuel\\neconomy ratings, as determined by the U.S. Department of Transportation and the Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”), and New Car\\nAssessment Program ratings as determined by NHTSA, if available.\\nOur vehicles sold outside of the U.S. are subject to similar foreign compliance, safety, environmental and other regulations. Many of those\\nregulations are different from those applicable in the U.S. and may require redesign and/or retesting. Some of those regulations impact or prevent the\\nrollout of new vehicle features.\\nSelf-Driving Vehicles\\nGenerally, laws pertaining to self-driving vehicles are evolving globally, and in some cases may create restrictions on features or vehicle designs\\nthat we develop. While there are currently no federal U.S. regulations pertaining specifically to self-driving vehicles or self-driving equipment, NHTSA has\\npublished recommended guidelines on self-driving vehicles, apart from the FMVSS and manufacturer reporting obligations, and retains the authority to\\ninvestigate and/or take action on the safety or compliance of any vehicle, equipment or features operating on public roads. Certain U.S. states also have\\nlegal restrictions on the operation, registration or licensure of self-driving vehicles, and many other states are considering them. This regulatory\\npatchwork increases the legal complexity with respect to self-driving vehicles in the U.S.\\nIn markets that follow the regulations of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (“ECE markets”), some requirements restrict the\\ndesign of advanced driver-assistance or self-driving features, which can compromise or prevent their use entirely. Other applicable laws, both current and\\nproposed, may hinder the path and timeline to introducing self-driving vehicles for sale and use in the markets where they apply.\\nOther key markets, including China, continue to consider self-driving regulation. Any implemented regulations may differ materially from the U.S.\\nand ECE markets, which may further increase the legal complexity of self-driving vehicles and limit or prevent certain features.\\n10\\nTable of Contents\\nAutomobile Manufacturer and Dealer Regulation\\nIn the U.S., state laws regulate the manufacture, distribution, sale and service of automobiles, and generally require motor vehicle manufacturers\\nand dealers to be licensed in order to sell vehicles directly to residents. Certain states have asserted that the laws in such states do not permit automobile\\nmanufacturers to be licensed as dealers or to act in the capacity of a dealer, or that they otherwise restrict a manufacturer’s ability to deliver or perform\\nwarranty repairs on vehicles. To sell vehicles to residents of states where we are not licensed as a dealer, we generally conduct the sale out of the state.\\nIn certain such states, we have opened “galleries” that serve an educational purpose and where sales may not occur.\\nSome automobile dealer trade associations have both challenged the legality of our operations in court and used administrative and legislative\\nprocesses to attempt to prohibit or limit our ability to operate existing stores or expand to new locations. Certain dealer associations have also actively\\nlobbied state licensing agencies and legislators to interpret existing laws or enact new laws in ways not favorable to our ownership and operation of our\\nown retail and service locations. We expect such challenges to continue, and we intend to actively fight any such efforts.\\nBattery Safety and Testing\\nOur battery packs are subject to various U.S. and international regulations that govern transport of “dangerous goods,” defined to include lithium-\\nion batteries, which may present a risk in transportation. We conduct testing to demonstrate our compliance with such regulations.\\nWe use lithium-ion cells in our high voltage battery packs in our vehicles and energy storage products. The use, storage and disposal of our battery\\npacks are regulated under existing laws and are the subject of ongoing regulatory changes that may add additional requirements in the future. We have\\nagreements with third party battery recycling companies to recycle our battery packs, and we are also piloting our own recycling technology.\\nSolar Energy—General\\nWe are subject to certain state and federal regulations applicable to solar and battery storage providers and sellers of electricity. To operate our\\nsystems, we enter into standard interconnection agreements with applicable utilities. Sales of electricity and non-sale equipment leases by third parties,\\nsuch as our leases and PPAs, have faced regulatory challenges in some states and jurisdictions.\\nSolar Energy—Net Metering\\nMost states in the U.S. make net energy metering, or net metering, available to solar customers. Net metering typically allows solar customers to\\ninterconnect their solar energy systems to the utility grid and offset their utility electricity purchases by receiving a bill credit for excess energy generated\\nby their solar energy system that is exported to the grid. In certain jurisdictions, regulators or utilities have reduced or eliminated the benefit available\\nunder net metering or have proposed to do so.\\nCompetition\\nAutomotive\\nThe worldwide automotive market is highly competitive and we expect it will become even more competitive in the future as a significant and\\ngrowing number of established and new automobile manufacturers, as well as other companies, have entered, or are reported to have plans to enter the\\nelectric vehicle market.\\nWe believe that our vehicles compete in the market based on both their traditional segment classification as well as their propulsion technology. For\\nexample, Cybertruck competes with other pickup trucks, Model S and Model X compete primarily with premium sedans and premium SUVs and Model 3\\nand Model Y compete with small to medium-sized sedans and compact SUVs, which are extremely competitive markets. Competing products typically\\ninclude internal combustion vehicles from more established automobile manufacturers; however, many established and new automobile manufacturers\\nhave entered or have announced plans to enter the market for electric and other alternative fuel vehicles. Overall, we believe these announcements and\\nvehicle introductions, including the introduction of electric vehicles into rental car company fleets, promote the development of the electric vehicle\\nmarket by highlighting the attractiveness of electric vehicles relative to the internal combustion vehicle. Many major automobile manufacturers have\\nelectric vehicles available today in major markets including the U.S., China and Europe, and other current and prospective automobile manufacturers are\\nalso developing electric vehicles. In addition, several manufacturers offer hybrid vehicles, including plug-in versions.\\n11\\nTable of Contents\\nWe believe that there is also increasing competition for our vehicle offerings as a platform for delivering self-driving technologies, charging solutions\\nand other features and services, and we expect to compete in this developing market through continued progress on our Autopilot, FSD and neural\\nnetwork capabilities, Supercharger network and our infotainment offerings.\\nEnergy Generation and Storage\\nEnergy Storage Systems\\nThe market for energy storage products is also highly competitive, and both established and emerging companies have introduced products that are\\nsimilar to our product portfolio or that are alternatives to the elements of our systems. We compete with these companies based on price, energy density\\nand efficiency. We believe that the specifications and features of our products, our strong brand and the modular, scalable nature of our energy storage\\nproducts give us a competitive advantage in our markets.\\nSolar Energy Systems\\nThe primary competitors to our solar energy business are the traditional local utility companies that supply energy to our potential customers. We\\ncompete with these traditional utility companies primarily based on price and the ease by which customers can switch to electricity generated by our\\nsolar energy systems. We also compete with solar energy companies that provide products and services similar to ours. Many solar energy companies\\nonly install solar energy systems, while others only provide financing for these installations. We believe we have a significant expansion opportunity with\\nour offerings and that the regulatory environment is increasingly conducive to the adoption of renewable energy systems.\\nIntellectual Property\\nWe place a strong emphasis on our innovative approach and proprietary designs which bring intrinsic value and uniqueness to our product portfolio.\\nAs part of our business, we seek to protect the underlying intellectual property rights of these innovations and designs such as with respect to patents,\\ntrademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, confidential information and other measures, including through employee and third-party nondisclosure\\nagreements and other contractual arrangements. For example, we place a high priority on obtaining patents to provide the broadest and strongest\\npossible protection to enable our freedom to operate our innovations and designs across all of our products and technologies as well as to protect and\\ndefend our product portfolio. We have also adopted a patent policy in which we irrevocably pledged that we will not initiate a lawsuit against any party for\\ninfringing our patents through activity relating to electric vehicles or related equipment for so long as such party is acting in good faith. We made this\\npledge in order to encourage the advancement of a common, rapidly-evolving platform for electric vehicles, thereby benefiting ourselves, other\\ncompanies making electric vehicles and the world.\\nEnvironmental, Social and Governance (ESG) and Human Capital Resources\\nESG\\nThe very purpose of Tesla's existence is to accelerate the world's transition to sustainable energy. We believe the world cannot reduce carbon\\nemissions without addressing both energy generation and consumption, and we are designing and manufacturing a complete energy and transportation\\necosystem to achieve this goal. As we expand, we are building each new factory to be more efficient and sustainably designed than the previous one,\\nincluding with respect to per-unit waste reduction and resource consumption, including water and energy usage. We are focused on further enhancing\\nsustainability of operations outside of our direct control, including reducing the carbon footprint of our supply chain.\\nWe are committed to sourcing only responsibly produced materials, and our suppliers are required to provide evidence of management systems that\\nensure social, environmental and sustainability best practices in their own operations, as well as to demonstrate a commitment to responsible sourcing\\ninto their supply chains. We have a zero-tolerance policy when it comes to child or forced labor and human trafficking by our suppliers and we look to the\\nOrganization for Economic Co-operation and Development Due Diligence Guidelines to inform our process and use feedback from our internal and\\nexternal stakeholders to find ways to continually improve. We are also driving safety in our own factories by focusing on worker engagement. Our\\nincidents per vehicle continue to drop even as our production volumes increase. We also strive to be an employer of choice by offering compelling,\\nimpactful jobs with best in-industry benefits.\\n12\\nTable of Contents\\nWe believe that sound corporate governance is critical to helping us achieve our goals, including with respect to ESG. We continue to evolve a\\ngovernance framework that exercises appropriate oversight of responsibilities at all levels throughout the company and manages its affairs consistent\\nwith high principles of business ethics. Our ESG Sustainability Council is made up of leaders from across our company, and regularly presents to our Board\\nof Directors, which oversees our ESG impacts, initiatives and priorities.\\nHuman Capital Resources\\nA competitive edge for Tesla is its ability to attract and retain high quality employees. During the past year, Tesla made substantial investments in\\nits workforce, further strengthening its standing as one of the most desirable and innovative companies to work for. As of December 31, 2023, our\\nemployee headcount worldwide was 140,473.\\nWe have created an environment that fosters growth opportunities, and as of this report, nearly two-thirds (65%) of our managers were promoted\\nfrom an internal, non-manager position, and 43% of our management employees have been with Tesla for more than five years. Tesla’s growth of 35%\\nover the past two years has offered internal career development to our employees as well as the ability to make a meaningful contribution to a\\nsustainable future.\\nWe are able to retain our employees, in part, not only because employees can enjoy ownership in Tesla through stock (of which 89% have been\\ngiven the opportunity to), but because we also provide them with excellent health benefits such as free counseling, paid parental leave, paid time off and\\nzero-premium medical plan options that are made available on the first day of employment.\\nWe recognize the positive impact that leaders can have on their teams and offer fundamental skills training and continuous development to all\\nleaders through various programs globally.\\nWe don’t stop there. Tesla has several other programs strategically designed to increase paths for greater career opportunity such as:\\n•\\nTechnician Trainee (Service) –\\u202fThe Tesla Technician Trainee Program provides on-the-job automotive maintenance training at Tesla,\\nresulting in an industry certification. Targeted at individuals with limited experience, whether in industry or vocational schools, the program\\nprepares trainees for employment as technicians. In 2023, we hired over 1,900 Technician Trainees across the U.S., Germany and China.\\n•\\nSTART (Manufacturing and Service) – Tesla START is an intensive training program that complements the Technician Trainee program and\\nequips individuals with the skills needed for a successful technician role at Tesla. We have partnered with colleges and technical academies to\\nlaunch Tesla START in the U.S., United Kingdom and Germany. In 2023, we hired over 350 trainees for manufacturing and service roles through\\nthis program, providing an opportunity to transition into full-time employment.\\n•\\nInternships – Annually, Tesla hires over 6,000 university and college students from around the world. We recruit from diverse student\\norganizations and campuses, seeking top talent passionate about our mission. Our interns engage in meaningful work from day one, and we\\noften offer them full-time positions post-internship.\\n•\\nMilitary Fellowship and Transition Programs –\\u202fThe Military Fellowship and Transition Programs are designed to offer exiting military service\\nmembers in the U.S. and Europe with career guidance on transitioning into the civil workforce. We partner with the career transition services of\\nEuropean Defence Ministries across five countries, as well as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce’s Hire our Heroes. These programs aim to convert\\nhigh-performing individuals to full-time roles and create a veteran talent pipeline.\\n•\\nApprenticeships – Tesla Apprenticeships are offered globally, providing academic and on-the-job training to prepare specialists in skilled\\ntrades. Apprentices will complete between one to four years of on-the-job training. Apprentice programs have seen skilled trade hires across the\\nU.S., Australia, Hong Kong, Korea and Germany.\\n•\\nManufacturing Development Program –\\u202fTesla's manufacturing pathway program is designed to provide graduating high school seniors with\\nthe financial resources, coursework and experience they need to start a successful manufacturing career at Tesla. We hired 373 graduates\\nthrough this program in 2023, and our goal in 2024 is grow this program to over 600 students annually across our Fremont Factory, Gigafactory\\nNevada, Gigafactory Texas and Gigafactory New York.\\n13\\nTable of Contents\\n•\\nEngineering Development Program –\\u202fLaunched in January 2024, this program targets recent college and university graduates for specialized\\nengineering fields. In collaboration with Austin Community College, the program educates early-career engineers in controls engineering,\\nenhancing their knowledge of high-demand technologies for U.S. manufacturing.\\nWe will continue to expand the opportunities for our employees to add skills and develop professionally with a new Employee Educational Assistance\\nProgram launching in the U.S. in the spring of 2024 to help employees pursue select certificates or degrees. With virtual, self-paced education options\\navailable, employees can pursue a new path or expand their knowledge while continuing to grow their career.\\nAt Tesla, our employees show up passionate about making a difference in the world and for each other. We remain unwavering in our demand that\\nour factories, offices, stores and service centers are places where our employees feel respected and appreciated. Our policies are designed to promote\\nfairness and respect for everyone. We hire, evaluate and promote employees based on their skills and performance. Everyone is expected to be\\ntrustworthy, demonstrate excellence in their performance and collaborate with others. With this in mind, we will not tolerate certain behaviors. These\\ninclude harassment, retaliation, violence, intimidation and discrimination of any kind on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, gender, sexual\\norientation, gender identity, gender expression, age, disability or veteran status.\\nAnti-harassment training is conducted on day one of new hire orientation for all employees and reoccurring for leaders. In addition, we run various\\nleadership development programs throughout the year aimed at enhancing leaders’ skills, and in particular, helping them to understand how to\\nappropriately respond to and address employee concerns.\\nEmployees are encouraged to speak up both in regard to misconduct and safety concerns and can do so by contacting the integrity line, submitting\\nconcerns through our Take Charge process, or notifying their Human Resource Partner or any member of management. Concerns are reviewed in\\naccordance with established protocols by investigators with expertise, who also review for trends and outcomes for remediation and appropriate controls.\\nResponding to questions timely is key so Human Resource Partners for each functional area are visible throughout facilities and are actively involved in\\ndriving culture and engagement alongside business leaders.\\nAvailable Information\\nWe file or furnish periodic reports and amendments thereto, including our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and\\nCurrent Reports on Form 8-K, proxy statements and other information with the SEC.

RISK FACTORS\\nYou should carefully consider the risks described below together with the other information set forth in this report, which could materially affect our\\nbusiness, financial condition and future results. The risks described below are not the only risks facing our company. Risks and uncertainties not currently\\nknown to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\\nRisks Related to Our Ability to Grow Our Business\\nWe may experience delays in launching and ramping the production of our products and features, or we may be unable to control\\nour manufacturing costs.\\nWe have previously experienced and may in the future experience launch and production ramp delays for new products and features. For example,\\nwe encountered unanticipated supplier issues that led to delays during the initial ramp of our first Model X and experienced challenges with a supplier and\\nwith ramping full automation for certain of our initial Model 3 manufacturing processes. In addition, we may introduce in the future new or unique\\nmanufacturing processes and design features for our products. As we expand our vehicle offerings and global footprint, there is no guarantee that we will\\nbe able to successfully and timely introduce and scale such processes or features.\\n14\\nTable of Contents\\nIn particular, our future business depends in large part on increasing the production of mass-market vehicles. In order to be successful, we will need\\nto implement, maintain and ramp efficient and cost-effective manufacturing capabilities, processes and supply chains and achieve the design tolerances,\\nhigh quality and output rates we have planned at our manufacturing facilities in California, Nevada, Texas, China, Germany and any future sites such as\\nMexico. We will also need to hire, train and compensate skilled employees to operate these facilities. Bottlenecks and other unexpected challenges such\\nas those we experienced in the past may arise during our production ramps, and we must address them promptly while continuing to improve\\nmanufacturing processes and reducing costs. If we are not successful in achieving these goals, we could face delays in establishing and/or sustaining our\\nproduct ramps or be unable to meet our related cost and profitability targets.\\nWe have experienced, and may also experience similar future delays in launching and/or ramping production of our energy storage products and\\nSolar Roof; new product versions or variants; new vehicles; and future features and services based on artificial intelligence. Likewise, we may encounter\\ndelays with the design, construction and regulatory or other approvals necessary to build and bring online future manufacturing facilities and products.\\nAny delay or other complication in ramping the production of our current products or the development, manufacture, launch and production ramp of\\nour future products, features and services, or in doing so cost-effectively and with high quality, may harm our brand, business, prospects, financial\\ncondition and operating results.\\nOur suppliers may fail to deliver components according to schedules, prices, quality and volumes that are acceptable to us, or we\\nmay be unable to manage these components effectively.\\nOur products contain thousands of parts purchased globally from hundreds of suppliers, including single-source direct suppliers, which exposes us to\\nmultiple potential sources of component shortages. Unexpected changes in business conditions, materials pricing, including inflation of raw material\\ncosts, labor issues, wars, trade policies, natural disasters, health epidemics such as the global COVID-19 pandemic, trade and shipping disruptions, port\\ncongestions, cyberattacks and other factors beyond our or our suppliers’ control could also affect these suppliers’ ability to deliver components to us or to\\nremain solvent and operational. For example, a global shortage of semiconductors beginning in early 2021 has caused challenges in the manufacturing\\nindustry and impacted our supply chain and production. Additionally, if our suppliers do not accurately forecast and effectively allocate production or if\\nthey are not willing to allocate sufficient production to us, or face other challenges such as insolvency, it may reduce our access to components and\\nrequire us to search for new suppliers. The unavailability of any component or supplier could result in production delays, idle manufacturing facilities,\\nproduct design changes and loss of access to important technology and tools for producing and supporting our products, as well as impact our capacity\\nexpansion and our ability to fulfill our obligations under customer contracts. Moreover, significant increases in our production or product design changes\\nby us have required and may in the future require us to procure additional components in a short amount of time. We have faced in the past, and may\\nface suppliers who are unwilling or unable to sustainably meet our timelines or our cost, quality and volume needs, which may increase our costs or\\nrequire us to replace them with other sources. Finally, as we construct new manufacturing facilities and add production lines to existing facilities, we may\\nexperience issues in correspondingly increasing the level of localized procurement at those facilities. While we believe that we will be able to secure\\nadditional or alternate sources or develop our own replacements for most of our components, there is no assurance that we will be able to do so quickly\\nor at all. Additionally, we may be unsuccessful in our continuous efforts to negotiate with existing suppliers to obtain cost reductions and avoid\\nunfavorable changes to terms, source less expensive suppliers for certain parts and redesign certain parts to make them less expensive to produce,\\nespecially in the case of increases in materials pricing. Any of these occurrences may harm our business, prospects, financial condition and operating\\nresults.\\nAs the scale of our vehicle production increases, we will also need to accurately forecast, purchase, warehouse and transport components at high\\nvolumes to our manufacturing facilities and servicing locations internationally. If we are unable to accurately match the timing and quantities of\\ncomponent purchases to our actual needs or successfully implement automation, inventory management and other systems to accommodate the\\nincreased complexity in our supply chain and parts management, we may incur unexpected production disruption, storage, transportation and write-off\\ncosts, which may harm our business and operating results.\\nWe may be unable to meet our projected construction timelines, costs and production ramps at new factories, or we may\\nexperience difficulties in generating and maintaining demand for products manufactured there.\\nOur ability to increase production of our vehicles on a sustained basis, make them affordable globally by accessing local supply chains and\\nworkforces and streamline delivery logistics is dependent on the construction and ramp of our current and future factories. The construction of and\\ncommencement and ramp of production at these factories are subject\\n15\\nTable of Contents\\nto a number of uncertainties inherent in all new manufacturing operations, including ongoing compliance with regulatory requirements, procurement and\\nmaintenance of construction, environmental and operational licenses and approvals for additional expansion, supply chain constraints, hiring, training and\\nretention of qualified employees and the pace of bringing production equipment and processes online with the capability to manufacture high-quality\\nunits at scale. Moreover, we will have to establish and ramp production of our proprietary battery cells and packs at our new factories, and we additionally\\nintend to incorporate sequential design and manufacturing changes into vehicles manufactured at each new factory. If we experience any issues or delays\\nin meeting our projected timelines, costs, capital efficiency and production capacity for our new factories, expanding and managing teams to implement\\niterative design and production changes there, maintaining and complying with the terms of any debt financing that we obtain to fund them or generating\\nand maintaining demand for the vehicles we manufacture there, our business, prospects, operating results and financial condition may be harmed.\\nWe may be unable to grow our global product sales, delivery and installation capabilities and our servicing and vehicle charging\\nnetworks, or we may be unable to accurately project and effectively manage our growth.\\nOur success will depend on our ability to continue to expand our sales capabilities. We are targeting a global mass demographic with a broad range\\nof potential customers, in which we have relatively limited experience projecting demand and pricing our products. We currently produce numerous\\ninternational variants at a limited number of factories, and if our specific demand expectations for these variants prove inaccurate, we may not be able to\\ntimely generate deliveries matched to the vehicles that we produce in the same timeframe or that are commensurate with the size of our operations in a\\ngiven region. Likewise, as we develop and grow our energy products and services worldwide, our success will depend on our ability to correctly forecast\\ndemand in various markets.\\nBecause we do not have independent dealer networks, we are responsible for delivering all of our vehicles to our customers. As our production\\nvolumes continue to grow, we have faced in the past, and may face challenges with deliveries at increasing volumes, particularly in international markets\\nrequiring significant transit times. We have also deployed a number of delivery models, such as deliveries to customers’ homes and workplaces and\\ntouchless deliveries, but there is no guarantee that such models will be scalable or be accepted globally. Likewise, as we ramp our energy products, we\\nare working to substantially increase our production and installation capabilities. If we experience production delays or inaccurately forecast demand, our\\nbusiness, financial condition and operating results may be harmed.\\nMoreover, because of our unique expertise with our vehicles, we recommend that our vehicles be serviced by us or by certain authorized\\nprofessionals. If we experience delays in adding servicing capacity or servicing our vehicles efficiently, or experience unforeseen issues with the reliability\\nof our vehicles, particularly higher-volume additions to our fleet such as Model 3 and Model Y, it could overburden our servicing capabilities and parts\\ninventory. Similarly, the increasing number of Tesla vehicles also requires us to continue to rapidly increase the number of our Supercharger stations and\\nconnectors throughout the world.\\nThere is no assurance that we will be able to ramp our business to meet our sales, delivery, installation, servicing and vehicle charging targets\\nglobally, that our projections on which such targets are based will prove accurate or that the pace of growth or coverage of our customer infrastructure\\nnetwork will meet customer expectations. These plans require significant cash investments and management resources and there is no guarantee that\\nthey will generate additional sales or installations of our products, or that we will be able to avoid cost overruns or be able to hire additional personnel to\\nsupport them. As we expand, we will also need to ensure our compliance with regulatory requirements in various jurisdictions applicable to the sale,\\ninstallation and servicing of our products, the sale or dispatch of electricity related to our energy products and the operation of Superchargers. If we fail to\\nmanage our growth effectively, it may harm our brand, business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.\\nWe will need to maintain and significantly grow our access to battery cells, including through the development and manufacture of\\nour own cells, and control our related costs.\\nWe are dependent on the continued supply of lithium-ion battery cells for our vehicles and energy storage products, and we will require substantially\\nmore cells to grow our business according to our plans. Currently, we rely on suppliers such as Panasonic and Contemporary Amperex Technology Co.\\nLimited (CATL) for these cells. We have to date fully qualified only a very limited number of such suppliers and have limited flexibility in changing\\nsuppliers. Any disruption in the supply of battery cells from our suppliers could limit production of our vehicles and energy storage products. In the long\\nterm, we intend to supplement cells from our suppliers with cells manufactured by us, which we believe will be more efficient, manufacturable at greater\\nvolumes and more cost-effective than currently available cells. However, our efforts to develop and manufacture such battery cells have required, and\\nmay continue to require, significant investments, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve these targets in the timeframes that we\\nhave planned or at all. If we are\\n16\\nTable of Contents\\nunable to do so, we may have to curtail our planned vehicle and energy storage product production or procure additional cells from suppliers at\\npotentially greater costs, either of which may harm our business and operating results.\\nIn addition, the cost and mass production of battery cells, whether manufactured by our suppliers or by us, depends in part upon the prices and\\navailability of raw materials such as lithium, nickel, cobalt and/or other metals. The prices for these materials fluctuate and their available supply may be\\nunstable, depending on market conditions and global demand for these materials. For example, as a result of increased global production of electric\\nvehicles and energy storage products, suppliers of these raw materials may be unable to meet our volume needs. Additionally, our suppliers may not be\\nwilling or able to reliably meet our timelines or our cost and quality needs, which may require us to replace them with other sources. Any reduced\\navailability of these materials may impact our access to cells and our growth, and any increases in their prices may reduce our profitability if we cannot\\nrecoup such costs through increased prices. Moreover, our inability to meet demand and any product price increases may harm our brand, growth,\\nprospects and operating results.\\nOur future growth and success are dependent upon consumers’ demand for electric vehicles and specifically our vehicles in an\\nautomotive industry that is generally competitive, cyclical and volatile.\\nThough we continue to see increased interest and adoption of electric vehicles, if the market for electric vehicles in general and Tesla vehicles in\\nparticular does not develop as we expect, develops more slowly than we expect, or if demand for our vehicles decreases in our markets or our vehicles\\ncompete with each other, our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results may be harmed.\\nIn addition, electric vehicles still constitute a small percentage of overall vehicle sales. As a result, the market for our vehicles could be negatively\\naffected by numerous factors, such as:\\n•\\nperceptions about electric vehicle features, quality, safety, performance and cost;\\n•\\nperceptions about the limited range over which electric vehicles may be driven on a single battery charge, and access to charging facilities;\\n•\\ncompetition, including from other types of alternative fuel vehicles, plug-in hybrid electric vehicles and high fuel-economy internal combustion\\nengine vehicles;\\n•\\nvolatility in the cost of oil, gasoline and energy;\\n•\\ngovernment regulations and economic incentives and conditions; and\\n•\\nconcerns about our future viability.\\nThe target demographics for our vehicles are highly competitive. Sales of vehicles in the automotive industry tend to be cyclical in many markets,\\nwhich may expose us to further volatility. We also cannot predict the duration or direction of current global trends or their sustained impact on consumer\\ndemand. Ultimately, we continue to monitor macroeconomic conditions to remain flexible and to optimize and evolve our business as appropriate, and\\nattempt to accurately project demand and infrastructure requirements globally and deploy our production, workforce and other resources accordingly.\\nRising interest rates may lead to consumers to increasingly pull back spending, including on our products, which may harm our demand, business and\\noperating results. If we experience unfavorable global market conditions, or if we cannot or do not maintain operations at a scope that is commensurate\\nwith such conditions or are later required to or choose to suspend such operations again, our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results\\nmay be harmed.\\nWe face strong competition for our products and services from a growing list of established and new competitors.\\nThe worldwide automotive market is highly competitive today and we expect it will become even more so in the future. A significant and growing\\nnumber of established and new automobile manufacturers, as well as other companies, have entered, or are reported to have plans to enter, the market\\nfor electric and other alternative fuel vehicles, including hybrid, plug-in hybrid and fully electric vehicles, as well as the market for self-driving technology\\nand other vehicle applications and software platforms. In some cases, our competitors offer or will offer electric vehicles in important markets such as\\nChina and Europe, and/or have announced an intention to produce electric vehicles exclusively at some point in the future. In addition, certain\\ngovernment and economic incentives which provide benefits to manufacturers who assemble domestically or have local suppliers, may provide a greater\\nbenefit to our competitors, which could negatively impact our profitability. Many of our competitors have significantly more or better-established\\nresources than we do to devote to the design, development, manufacturing, distribution, promotion, sale and support of their products. Increased\\ncompetition could result in our lower vehicle unit sales, price reductions, revenue shortfalls, loss of customers and loss of market share, which may harm\\nour business, financial condition and operating results.\\n17\\nTable of Contents\\nWe also face competition in our energy generation and storage business from other manufacturers, developers, installers and service providers of\\ncompeting energy technologies, as well as from large utilities. Decreases in the retail or wholesale prices of electricity from utilities or other renewable\\nenergy sources could make our products less attractive to customers and lead to an increased rate of customer defaults.\\nRisks Related to Our Operations\\nWe may experience issues with lithium-ion cells or other components manufactured at our Gigafactories, which may harm the\\nproduction and profitability of our vehicle and energy storage products.\\nOur plan to grow the volume and profitability of our vehicles and energy storage products depends on significant lithium-ion battery cell production,\\nincluding by our partner Panasonic at Gigafactory Nevada. We also produce several vehicle components at our Gigafactories, such as battery modules and\\npacks and drive units, and manufacture energy storage products. If we are unable to or otherwise do not maintain and grow our respective operations, or\\nif we are unable to do so cost-effectively or hire and retain highly-skilled personnel there, our ability to manufacture our products profitably would be\\nlimited, which may harm our business and operating results.\\nFinally, the high volumes of lithium-ion cells and battery modules and packs manufactured by us and by our suppliers are stored and recycled at our\\nvarious facilities. Any mishandling of these products may cause disruption to the operation of such facilities. While we have implemented safety\\nprocedures related to the handling of the cells, there can be no assurance that a safety issue or fire related to the cells would not disrupt our operations.\\nAny such disruptions or issues may harm our brand and business.\\nWe face risks associated with maintaining and expanding our international operations, including unfavorable and uncertain\\nregulatory, political, economic, tax and labor conditions.\\nWe are subject to legal and regulatory requirements, political uncertainty and social, environmental and economic conditions in numerous\\njurisdictions, including markets in which we generate significant sales, over which we have little control and which are inherently unpredictable. Our\\noperations in such jurisdictions, particularly as a company based in the U.S., create risks relating to conforming our products to regulatory and safety\\nrequirements and charging and other electric infrastructures; organizing local operating entities; establishing, staffing and managing foreign business\\nlocations; attracting local customers; navigating foreign government taxes, regulations and permit requirements; enforceability of our contractual rights;\\ntrade restrictions, customs regulations, tariffs and price or exchange controls; and preferences in foreign nations for domestically manufactured products.\\nFor example, we monitor tax legislation changes on a global basis, including changes arising as a result of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and\\nDevelopment’s multi-jurisdictional plan of action to address base erosion and profit shifting. Such conditions may increase our costs, impact our ability to\\nsell our products and require significant management attention, and may harm our business if we are unable to manage them effectively.\\nOur business may suffer if our products or features contain defects, fail to perform as expected or take longer than expected to\\nbecome fully functional.\\nIf our products contain design or manufacturing defects, whether relating to our software or hardware, that cause them not to perform as designed\\nor intended or that require repair, or certain features of our vehicles such as new Autopilot or FSD Capability features take longer than expected to\\nbecome enabled, are legally restricted or become subject to onerous regulation, our ability to develop, market and sell our products and services may be\\nharmed, and we may experience delivery delays, product recalls, allegations of product liability, breach of warranty and related consumer protection\\nclaims and significant warranty and other expenses. While we are continuously working to develop and improve our products’ capability and performance,\\nthere is no guarantee that any incremental changes in the specific software or equipment we deploy in our vehicles over time will not result in initial\\nfunctional disparities from prior iterations or will perform as forecast in the timeframe we anticipate, or at all. Although we attempt to remedy any issues\\nwe observe in our products as effectively and rapidly as possible, such efforts may not be timely, may hamper production or may not completely satisfy\\nour customers. We have performed, and continue to perform, extensive internal testing on our products and features, though, like the rest of the industry,\\nwe currently have a limited frame of reference by which to evaluate certain aspects of their long-term quality, reliability, durability and performance\\ncharacteristics, including exposure to or consequence of external attacks. While we attempt to identify and address or remedy defects we identify pre-\\nproduction and sale, there may be latent defects that we may be unable to detect or control for in our products, and thereby address, prior to their sale to\\nor installation for customers.\\n18\\nTable of Contents\\nWe may be required to defend or insure against product liability claims.\\nThe automobile industry generally experiences significant product liability claims, and as such we face the risk of such claims in the event our\\nvehicles do not perform or are claimed to not have performed as expected. As is true for other automakers, our vehicles have been involved and we\\nexpect in the future will be involved in accidents resulting in death or personal injury, and such accidents where Autopilot, Enhanced Autopilot or FSD\\nCapability features are engaged are the subject of significant public attention, especially in light of NHTSA’s Standing General Order requiring reports\\nregarding crashes involving vehicles with advanced driver assistance systems. We have experienced, and we expect to continue to face, claims and\\nregulatory scrutiny arising from or related to misuse or claimed failures or alleged misrepresentations of such new technologies that we are pioneering. In\\naddition, the battery packs that we produce make use of lithium-ion cells. On rare occasions, lithium-ion cells can rapidly release the energy they contain\\nby venting smoke and flames in a manner that can ignite nearby materials as well as other lithium-ion cells. While we have designed our battery packs to\\npassively contain any single cell’s release of energy without spreading to neighboring cells, there can be no assurance that a field or testing failure of our\\nvehicles or other battery packs that we produce will not occur, in particular due to a high-speed crash. Likewise, as our solar energy systems and energy\\nstorage products generate and store electricity, they have the potential to fail or cause injury to people or property. Any product liability claim may\\nsubject us to lawsuits and substantial monetary damages, product recalls or redesign efforts, and even a meritless claim may require us to defend it, all of\\nwhich may generate negative publicity and be expensive and time-consuming. In most jurisdictions, we generally self-insure against the risk of product\\nliability claims for vehicle exposure, meaning that any product liability claims will likely have to be paid from company funds and not by insurance.\\nWe will need to maintain public credibility and confidence in our long-term business prospects in order to succeed.\\nIn order to maintain and grow our business, we must maintain credibility and confidence among customers, suppliers, analysts, investors, ratings\\nagencies and other parties in our long-term financial viability and business prospects. Maintaining such confidence may be challenging due to our limited\\noperating history relative to established competitors; customer unfamiliarity with our products; any delays we may experience in scaling manufacturing,\\ndelivery and service operations to meet demand; competition and uncertainty regarding the future of electric vehicles or our other products and services;\\nour quarterly production and sales performance compared with market expectations; and other factors including those over which we have no control. In\\nparticular, Tesla’s products, business, results of operations, and statements and actions of Tesla and its management are subject to significant amounts of\\ncommentary by a range of third parties. Such attention can include criticism, which may be exaggerated or unfounded, such as speculation regarding the\\nsufficiency or stability of our management team. Any such negative perceptions, whether caused by us or not, may harm our business and make it more\\ndifficult to raise additional funds if needed.\\nWe may be unable to effectively grow, or manage the compliance, residual value, financing and credit risks related to, our various\\nfinancing programs.\\nWe offer financing arrangements for our vehicles in North America, Europe and Asia primarily ourselves and through various financial institutions.\\nWe also currently offer vehicle financing arrangements directly through our local subsidiaries in certain markets. Depending on the country, such\\narrangements are available for specified models and may include operating leases directly with us under which we typically receive only a very small\\nportion of the total vehicle purchase price at the time of lease, followed by a stream of payments over the term of the lease. We have also offered various\\narrangements for customers of our solar energy systems whereby they pay us a fixed payment to lease or finance the purchase of such systems or\\npurchase electricity generated by them. If we do not successfully monitor and comply with applicable national, state and/or local financial regulations and\\nconsumer protection laws governing these transactions, we may become subject to enforcement actions or penalties.\\nThe profitability of any directly-leased vehicles returned to us at the end of their leases depends on our ability to accurately project our vehicles’\\nresidual values at the outset of the leases, and such values may fluctuate prior to the end of their terms depending on various factors such as supply and\\ndemand of our used vehicles, economic cycles and the pricing of new vehicles. We have made in the past and may make in the future certain adjustments\\nto our prices from time to time in the ordinary course of business, which may impact the residual values of our vehicles and reduce the profitability of our\\nvehicle leasing program. The funding and growth of this program also rely on our ability to secure adequate financing and/or business partners. If we are\\nunable to adequately fund our leasing program through internal funds, partners or other financing sources, and compelling alternative financing programs\\nare not available for our customers who may expect or need such options, we may be unable to grow our vehicle deliveries. Furthermore, if our vehicle\\nleasing business grows substantially, our business may suffer if we cannot effectively manage the resulting greater levels of residual risk.\\n19\\nTable of Contents\\nSimilarly, we have provided resale value guarantees to vehicle customers and partners for certain financing programs, under which such\\ncounterparties may sell their vehicles back to us at certain points in time at pre-determined amounts. However, actual resale values are subject to\\nfluctuations over the term of the financing arrangements, such as from the vehicle pricing changes discussed above. If the actual resale values of any\\nvehicles resold or returned to us pursuant to these programs are materially lower than the pre-determined amounts we have offered, our financial\\ncondition and operating results may be harmed.\\nFinally, our vehicle and solar energy system financing programs and our energy storage sales programs also expose us to customer credit risk. In\\nthe event of a widespread economic downturn or other catastrophic event, our customers may be unable or unwilling to satisfy their payment obligations\\nto us on a timely basis or at all. If a significant number of our customers default, we may incur substantial credit losses and/or impairment charges with\\nrespect to the underlying assets.\\nWe must manage ongoing obligations under our agreement with the Research Foundation for the State University of New York\\nrelating to our Gigafactory New York.\\nWe are party to an operating lease and a research and development agreement through the State University of New York (the “SUNY Foundation”).\\nThese agreements provide for the construction and use of our Gigafactory New York, which we have primarily used for the development and production of\\nour Solar Roof and other solar products and components, energy storage components and Supercharger components, and for other lessor-approved\\nfunctions. Under this agreement, we are obligated to, among other things, meet employment targets as well as specified minimum numbers of personnel\\nin the State of New York and in Buffalo, New York and spend or incur $5.00 billion in combined capital, operational expenses, costs of goods sold and\\nother costs in the State of New York during a period that was initially 10 years beginning April 30, 2018. As of December 31, 2023, we are currently in\\nexcess of such targets relating to investments and personnel in the State of New York and Buffalo. While we expect to have and grow significant\\noperations at Gigafactory New York and the surrounding Buffalo area, any failure by us in any year over the course of the term of the agreement to meet\\nall applicable future obligations may result in our obligation to pay a “program payment” of $41 million to the SUNY Foundation for such year, the\\ntermination of our lease at Gigafactory New York which may require us to pay additional penalties, and/or the need to adjust certain of our operations.\\nAny of the foregoing events may harm our business, financial condition and operating results.\\nIf we are unable to attract, hire and retain key employees and qualified personnel, our ability to compete may be harmed.\\nThe loss of the services of any of our key employees or any significant portion of our workforce could disrupt our operations or delay the\\ndevelopment, introduction and ramp of our products and services. In particular, we are highly dependent on the services of Elon Musk, Technoking of\\nTesla and our Chief Executive Officer. None of our key employees is bound by an employment agreement for any specific term and we may not be able to\\nsuccessfully attract and retain senior leadership necessary to grow our business. Our future success also depends upon our ability to attract, hire and\\nretain a large number of engineering, manufacturing, marketing, sales and delivery, service, installation, technology and support personnel, especially to\\nsupport our planned high-volume product sales, market and geographical expansion and technological innovations. If we are not successful in managing\\nthese risks, our business, financial condition and operating results may be harmed.\\nEmployees may leave Tesla or choose other employers over Tesla due to various factors, such as a very competitive labor market for talented\\nindividuals with automotive or technology experience, or any negative publicity related to us. In regions where we have or will have operations,\\nparticularly significant engineering and manufacturing centers, there is strong competition for individuals with skillsets needed for our business, including\\nspecialized knowledge of electric vehicles, engineering and electrical and building construction expertise. We also compete with both mature and\\nprosperous companies that have far greater financial resources than we do and start-ups and emerging companies that promise short-term growth\\nopportunities.\\nFinally, our compensation philosophy for all of our personnel reflects our startup origins, with an emphasis on equity-based awards and benefits in\\norder to closely align their incentives with the long-term interests of our stockholders. We periodically seek and obtain approval from our stockholders for\\nfuture increases to the number of awards available under our equity incentive and employee stock purchase plans. If we are unable to obtain the requisite\\nstockholder approvals for such future increases, we may have to expend additional cash to compensate our employees and our ability to retain and hire\\nqualified personnel may be harmed.\\n20\\nTable of Contents\\nWe are highly dependent on the services of Elon Musk, Technoking of Tesla and our Chief Executive Officer.\\nWe are highly dependent on the services of Elon Musk, Technoking of Tesla and our Chief Executive Officer. Although Mr. Musk spends significant\\ntime with Tesla and is highly active in our management, he does not devote his full time and attention to Tesla. Mr. Musk also currently serves as Chief\\nExecutive Officer and Chief Technical Officer of Space Exploration Technologies Corp., a developer and manufacturer of space launch vehicles, Chairman\\nand Chief Technical Officer of X Corp., a social media company, and is involved in other emerging technology ventures.\\nOur information technology systems or data, or those of our service providers or customers or users could be subject to cyber-\\nattacks or other security incidents, which could result in data breaches, intellectual property theft, claims, litigation, regulatory\\ninvestigations, significant liability, reputational damage and other adverse consequences.\\nWe continue to expand our information technology systems as our operations grow, such as product data management, procurement, inventory\\nmanagement, production planning and execution, sales, service and logistics, dealer management, financial, tax and regulatory compliance systems. This\\nincludes the implementation of new internally developed systems and the deployment of such systems in the U.S. and abroad. While, we maintain\\ninformation technology measures designed to protect us against intellectual property theft, data breaches, sabotage and other external or internal cyber-\\nattacks or misappropriation, our systems and those of our service providers are potentially vulnerable to malware, ransomware, viruses, denial-of-service\\nattacks, phishing attacks, social engineering, computer hacking, unauthorized access, exploitation of bugs, defects and vulnerabilities, breakdowns,\\ndamage, interruptions, system malfunctions, power outages, terrorism, acts of vandalism, security breaches, security incidents, inadvertent or intentional\\nactions by employees or other third parties, and other cyber-attacks.\\nTo the extent any security incident results in unauthorized access or damage to or acquisition, use, corruption, loss, destruction, alteration or\\ndissemination of our data, including intellectual property and personal information, or our products or vehicles, or for it to be believed or reported that any\\nof these occurred, it could disrupt our business, harm our reputation, compel us to comply with applicable data breach notification laws, subject us to time\\nconsuming, distracting and expensive litigation, regulatory investigation and oversight, mandatory corrective action, require us to verify the correctness\\nof database contents, or otherwise subject us to liability under laws, regulations and contractual obligations, including those that protect the privacy and\\nsecurity of personal information. This could result in increased costs to us and result in significant legal and financial exposure and/or reputational harm.\\nWe also rely on service providers, and similar incidents relating to their information technology systems could also have a material adverse effect on\\nour business. There have been and may continue to be significant supply chain attacks. Our service providers, including our workforce management\\nsoftware provider, have been subject to ransomware and other security incidents, and we cannot guarantee that our or our service providers’ systems\\nhave not been breached or that they do not contain exploitable defects, bugs, or vulnerabilities that could result in a security incident, or other disruption\\nto, our or our service providers’ systems. Our ability to monitor our service providers’ security measures is limited, and, in any event, malicious third\\nparties may be able to circumvent those security measures.\\nFurther, the implementation, maintenance, segregation and improvement of these systems require significant management time, support and cost,\\nand there are inherent risks associated with developing, improving and expanding our core systems as well as implementing new systems and updating\\ncurrent systems, including disruptions to the related areas of business operation. These risks may affect our ability to manage our data and inventory,\\nprocure parts or supplies or manufacture, sell, deliver and service products, adequately protect our intellectual property or achieve and maintain\\ncompliance with, or realize available benefits under, tax laws and other applicable regulations.\\nMoreover, if we do not successfully implement, maintain or expand these systems as planned, our operations may be disrupted, our ability to\\naccurately and/or timely report our financial results could be impaired and deficiencies may arise in our internal control over financial reporting, which\\nmay impact our ability to certify our financial results. Moreover, our proprietary information, including intellectual property and personal information,\\ncould be compromised or misappropriated and our reputation may be adversely affected. If these systems or their functionality do not operate as we\\nexpect them to, we may be required to expend significant resources to make corrections or find alternative sources for performing these functions.\\n21\\nTable of Contents\\nAny unauthorized control or manipulation of our products’ systems could result in loss of confidence in us and our products.\\nOur products contain complex information technology systems. For example, our vehicles and energy storage products are designed with built-in\\ndata connectivity to accept and install periodic remote updates from us to improve or update their functionality. While we have implemented security\\nmeasures intended to prevent unauthorized access to our information technology networks, our products and their systems, malicious entities have\\nreportedly attempted, and may attempt in the future, to gain unauthorized access to modify, alter and use such networks, products and systems to gain\\ncontrol of, or to change, our products’ functionality, user interface and performance characteristics or to gain access to data stored in or generated by our\\nproducts. We encourage reporting of potential vulnerabilities in the security of our products through our security vulnerability reporting policy, and we\\naim to remedy any reported and verified vulnerability. However, there can be no assurance that any vulnerabilities will not be exploited before they can\\nbe identified, or that our remediation efforts are or will be successful.\\nAny unauthorized access to or control of our products or their systems or any loss of data could result in legal claims or government investigations.\\nIn addition, regardless of their veracity, reports of unauthorized access to our products, their systems or data, as well as other factors that may result in\\nthe perception that our products, their systems or data are capable of being hacked, may harm our brand, prospects and operating results. We have been\\nthe subject of such reports in the past.\\nOur business may be adversely affected by any disruptions caused by union activities.\\nIt is not uncommon for employees of certain trades at companies such as ours to belong to a union, which can result in higher employee costs and\\nincreased risk of work stoppages. Moreover, regulations in some jurisdictions outside of the U.S. mandate employee participation in industrial collective\\nbargaining agreements and work councils with certain consultation rights with respect to the relevant companies’ operations. Although we work diligently\\nto provide the best possible work environment for our employees, they may still decide to join or seek recognition to form a labor union, or we may be\\nrequired to become a union signatory. From time to time, labor unions have engaged in campaigns to organize certain of our operations, as part of which\\nsuch unions have filed unfair labor practice charges against us with the National Labor Relations Board (the “NLRB”), and they may do so in the future.\\nAny unfavorable ultimate outcome for Tesla may have a negative impact on the perception of Tesla’s treatment of our employees. Furthermore, we are\\ndirectly or indirectly dependent upon companies with unionized work forces, such as suppliers and trucking and freight companies. Any work stoppages or\\nstrikes organized by such unions could delay the manufacture and sale of our products and may harm our business and operating results.\\nWe may choose to or be compelled to undertake product recalls or take other similar actions.\\nAs a manufacturing company, we must manage the risk of product recalls with respect to our products. Recalls for our vehicles have resulted from\\nvarious hardware and software-related safety concerns or non-compliance determinations. In addition to recalls initiated by us for various causes, testing\\nof or investigations into our products by government regulators or industry groups may compel us to initiate product recalls or may result in negative\\npublic perceptions about the safety of our products, even if we disagree with the defect determination or have data that contradicts it. In the future, we\\nmay voluntarily or involuntarily initiate recalls if any of our products are determined by us or a regulator to contain a safety defect or be noncompliant\\nwith applicable laws and regulations, such as U.S. Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards. Such recalls, whether voluntary or involuntary or caused by\\nsystems or components engineered or manufactured by us or our suppliers, could result in significant expense, supply chain complications and service\\nburdens, and may harm our brand, business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.\\nOur current and future warranty reserves may be insufficient to cover future warranty claims.\\nWe provide a manufacturer’s warranty on all new and used Tesla vehicles we sell directly to customers. We also provide certain warranties with\\nrespect to the energy generation and storage systems we sell, including on their installation and maintenance. For components not manufactured by us,\\nwe generally pass through to our customers the applicable manufacturers’ warranties, but may retain some warranty responsibilities for some or all of the\\nlife of such components. As part of our energy generation and storage system contracts, we may provide the customer with performance guarantees that\\nguarantee that the underlying system will meet or exceed the minimum energy generation or other energy performance requirements specified in the\\ncontract. Under these performance guarantees, we generally bear the risk of electricity production or other performance shortfalls, including in some\\ncases shortfalls caused by failures in components from third party manufacturers. These risks are exacerbated in the event such manufacturers cease\\noperations or fail to honor their warranties.\\n22\\nTable of Contents\\nIf our warranty reserves are inadequate to cover future warranty claims on our products, our financial condition and operating results may be\\nharmed. Warranty reserves include our management’s best estimates of the projected costs to repair or to replace items under warranty, which are based\\non actual claims incurred to date and an estimate of the nature, frequency and costs of future claims. Such estimates are inherently uncertain and\\nchanges to our historical or projected experience, especially with respect to products that we have introduced relatively recently and/or that we expect to\\nproduce at significantly greater volumes than our past products, may cause material changes to our warranty reserves in the future.\\nOur insurance coverage strategy may not be adequate to protect us from all business risks.\\nWe may be subject, in the ordinary course of business, to losses resulting from products liability, accidents, acts of God and other claims against us,\\nfor which we may have no insurance coverage. As a general matter, we do not maintain as much insurance coverage as many other companies do, and in\\nsome cases, we do not maintain any at all. Additionally, the policies that we do have may include significant deductibles or self-insured retentions, policy\\nlimitations and exclusions, and we cannot be certain that our insurance coverage will be sufficient to cover all future losses or claims against us. A loss\\nthat is uninsured or which exceeds policy limits may require us to pay substantial amounts, which may harm our financial condition and operating results.\\nOur debt agreements contain covenant restrictions that may limit our ability to operate our business.\\nThe terms of certain of our debt facilities contain, and any of our other future debt agreements may contain, covenant restrictions that may limit our\\nability to operate our business, including restrictions on our and/or our subsidiaries’ ability to, among other things, incur additional debt or create liens. In\\naddition, under certain circumstances we are required to maintain a certain amount of liquidity. As a result of these covenants, our ability to respond to\\nchanges in business and economic conditions and engage in beneficial transactions, including to obtain additional financing as needed, may be restricted.\\nFurthermore, our failure to comply with our debt covenants could result in a default under our debt agreements, which could permit the holders to\\naccelerate our obligation to repay the debt. If any of our debt is accelerated, we may not have sufficient funds available to repay it.\\nAdditional funds may not be available to us when we need or want them.\\nOur business and our future plans for expansion are capital-intensive, and the specific timing of cash inflows and outflows may fluctuate\\nsubstantially from period to period. We may need or want to raise additional funds through the issuance of equity, equity-related or debt securities or\\nthrough obtaining credit from financial institutions to fund, together with our principal sources of liquidity, the costs of developing and manufacturing our\\ncurrent or future products, to pay any significant unplanned or accelerated expenses or for new significant strategic investments, or to refinance our\\nsignificant consolidated indebtedness, even if not required to do so by the terms of such indebtedness. We cannot be certain that additional funds will be\\navailable to us on favorable terms when required, or at all. If we cannot raise additional funds when we need them, our financial condition, results of\\noperations, business and prospects could be materially and adversely affected.\\nWe may be negatively impacted by any early obsolescence of our manufacturing equipment.\\nWe depreciate the cost of our manufacturing equipment over their expected useful lives. However, product cycles or manufacturing technology may\\nchange periodically, and we may decide to update our products or manufacturing processes more quickly than expected. Moreover, improvements in\\nengineering and manufacturing expertise and efficiency may result in our ability to manufacture our products using less of our currently installed\\nequipment. Alternatively, as we ramp and mature the production of our products to higher levels, we may discontinue the use of already installed\\nequipment in favor of different or additional equipment. The useful life of any equipment that would be retired early as a result would be shortened,\\ncausing the depreciation on such equipment to be accelerated, and our results of operations may be harmed.\\nThere is no guarantee that we will have sufficient cash flow from our business to pay our indebtedness or that we will not incur\\nadditional indebtedness.\\nAs of December 31, 2023, we and our subsidiaries had outstanding $4.68 billion in aggregate principal amount of indebtedness (see Note 11, Debt,\\nto the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K). Our consolidated indebtedness may increase our\\nvulnerability to any generally adverse economic and industry conditions. We and our subsidiaries may, subject to the limitations in the terms of our\\nexisting and future indebtedness, incur additional debt, secure existing or future debt or recapitalize our debt.\\n23\\nTable of Contents\\nOur ability to make scheduled payments of the principal and interest on our indebtedness when due, to make payments upon conversion or\\nrepurchase demands with respect to our convertible senior notes or to refinance our indebtedness as we may need or desire, depends on our future\\nperformance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control. Our business may not continue to generate cash\\nflow from operations in the future sufficient to satisfy our obligations under our existing indebtedness and any future indebtedness we may incur, and to\\nmake necessary capital expenditures. If we are unable to generate such cash flow, we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as\\nreducing or delaying investments or capital expenditures, selling assets, refinancing or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous\\nor highly dilutive. Our ability to refinance existing or future indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. In\\naddition, our ability to make payments may be limited by law, by regulatory authority or by agreements governing our future indebtedness. We may not\\nbe able to engage in these activities on desirable terms or at all, which may result in a default on our existing or future indebtedness and harm our\\nfinancial condition and operating results.\\nWe are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates.\\nWe transact business globally in multiple currencies and have foreign currency risks related to our revenue, costs of revenue, operating expenses\\nand localized subsidiary debt denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. To the extent we have significant revenues denominated in such\\nforeign currencies, any strengthening of the U.S. dollar would tend to reduce our revenues as measured in U.S. dollars, as we have historically\\nexperienced, and are currently experiencing. In addition, a portion of our costs and expenses have been, and we anticipate will continue to be,\\ndenominated in foreign currencies. If we do not have fully offsetting revenues in these currencies and if the value of the U.S. dollar depreciates\\nsignificantly against these currencies, our costs as measured in U.S. dollars as a percent of our revenues will correspondingly increase and our margins\\nwill suffer. As a result, our operating results may be harmed.\\nWe may not be able to adequately protect or defend ourselves against intellectual property infringement claims, which may be\\ntime-consuming and expensive, or affect the freedom to operate our business.\\nOur competitors or other third parties may hold or obtain patents, copyrights, trademarks or other proprietary rights that could prevent, limit or\\ninterfere with our ability to make, use, develop, sell or market our products and services, which could make it more difficult for us to operate our business.\\nFrom time to time, the holders of such intellectual property rights may assert their rights and urge us to take licenses and/or may bring suits alleging\\ninfringement or misappropriation of such rights, which could result in substantial costs, negative publicity and management attention, regardless of merit.\\nIn addition, the effective protection for our brands, technologies, and proprietary information may be limited or unavailable in certain countries,\\nmaking it difficult to protect our intellectual property from misappropriation or infringement. Although we make reasonable efforts to maintain the\\nconfidentiality of our proprietary information, we cannot guarantee that these actions will deter or prevent misappropriation of our intellectual property.\\nThe theft or unauthorized use or publication of our trade secrets and confidential information could affect our competitive position.\\nWhile we endeavor to obtain and protect the intellectual property rights that we expect will allow us to retain or advance our strategic initiatives in\\nthese circumstances, there can be no assurance that we will be able to adequately identify and protect the portions of intellectual property that are\\nstrategic to our business, or mitigate the risk of potential suits or other legal demands by third parties. Accordingly, we may consider the entering into\\nlicensing agreements with respect to such rights, although no assurance can be given that such licenses can be obtained on acceptable terms or that\\nlitigation will not occur, and such licenses and associated litigation could significantly increase our operating expenses. Further, if we are determined to\\nhave or believe there is a high likelihood that we have infringed upon a third party’s intellectual property rights, we may be required to cease making,\\nselling or incorporating certain components or intellectual property into the goods and services we offer, to pay substantial damages and/or license\\nroyalties, to redesign our products and services and/or to establish and maintain alternative branding for our products and services. In the event that we\\nare required to take one or more such actions, our brand, business, financial condition and operating results may be harmed.\\nIncreased scrutiny and changing expectations from stakeholders with respect to the Company’s ESG practices may result in\\nadditional costs or risks.\\nCompanies across many industries are facing increasing scrutiny related to their environmental, social and governance (ESG) practices. Investor\\nadvocacy groups, certain institutional investors, investment funds and other influential investors are also increasingly focused on ESG practices and in\\nrecent years have placed increasing importance on the non-financial impacts of their investments. While our mission is to accelerate the world’s transition\\nto sustainable energy, if our ESG practices do not meet investor or other industry stakeholder expectations, which continue to evolve, we may incur\\nadditional costs and our brand, ability to attract and retain qualified employees and business may be harmed.\\n24\\nTable of Contents\\nOur operations could be adversely affected by events outside of our control, such as natural disasters, wars or health epidemics.\\nWe may be impacted by natural disasters, wars, health epidemics, weather conditions, the long-term effects of climate change, power outages or\\nother events outside of our control. For example, our Fremont Factory and Gigafactory Nevada are located in seismically active regions in Northern\\nCalifornia and Nevada, and our Gigafactory Shanghai is located in a flood-prone area. Moreover, the area in which our Gigafactory Texas is located\\nexperienced severe winter storms in the first quarter of 2021 that had a widespread impact on utilities and transportation. If major disasters such as\\nearthquakes, floods or other climate-related events occur, or our information system or communication breaks down or operates improperly, our\\nheadquarters and production facilities may be seriously damaged, or we may have to stop or delay production and shipment of our products. In addition,\\nthe global COVID-19 pandemic has impacted economic markets, manufacturing operations, supply chains, employment and consumer behavior in nearly\\nevery geographic region and industry across the world, and we have been, and may in the future be, adversely affected as a result. Also, the broader\\nconsequences in the current conflict between Russia and Ukraine, which may include further embargoes, regional instability and geopolitical shifts;\\nairspace bans relating to certain routes, or strategic decisions to alter certain routes; and potential retaliatory action by the Russian government against\\ncompanies, and the extent of the conflict on our business and operating results cannot be predicted. We may incur expenses or delays relating to such\\nevents outside of our control, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, operating results and financial condition.\\nRisks Related to Government Laws and Regulations\\nDemand for our products and services may be impacted by the status of government and economic incentives supporting the\\ndevelopment and adoption of such products.\\nGovernment and economic incentives that support the development and adoption of electric vehicles in the U.S. and abroad, including certain tax\\nexemptions, tax credits and rebates, may be reduced, eliminated, amended or exhausted from time to time. For example, previously available incentives\\nfavoring electric vehicles in certain areas have expired or were cancelled or temporarily unavailable, and in some cases were not eventually replaced or\\nreinstituted, which may have negatively impacted sales. In addition, certain government and economic incentives may also be implemented or amended\\nto provide benefits to manufacturers who assemble domestically, have local suppliers or have other characteristics that may not apply to Tesla. Such\\ndevelopments could negatively impact demand for our vehicles, and we and our customers may have to adjust to them, including through pricing\\nmodifications.\\nIn addition, certain governmental rebates, tax credits and other financial incentives that are currently available with respect to our solar and energy\\nstorage product businesses allow us to lower our costs and encourage customers to buy our products and investors to invest in our solar financing funds.\\nHowever, these incentives may expire when the allocated funding is exhausted, reduced or terminated as renewable energy adoption rates increase,\\nsometimes without warning. Likewise, in jurisdictions where net metering is currently available, our customers receive bill credits from utilities for energy\\nthat their solar energy systems generate and export to the grid in excess of the electric load they use. The benefit available under net metering has been\\nor has been proposed to be reduced, altered or eliminated in several jurisdictions, and has also been contested and may continue to be contested before\\nthe Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. Any reductions or terminations of such incentives may harm our business, prospects, financial condition and\\noperating results by making our products less competitive for customers, increasing our cost of capital and adversely impacting our ability to attract\\ninvestment partners and to form new financing funds for our solar and energy storage assets.\\nFinally, we and our fund investors claim these U.S. federal tax credits and certain state incentives in amounts based on independently appraised fair\\nmarket values of our solar and energy storage systems. Some governmental authorities have audited such values and in certain cases have determined\\nthat these values should be lower, and they may do so again in the future. Such determinations may result in adverse tax consequences and/or our\\nobligation to make indemnification or other payments to our funds or fund investors.\\nWe are subject to evolving laws and regulations that could impose substantial costs, legal prohibitions or unfavorable changes\\nupon our operations or products.\\nAs we grow our manufacturing operations in additional regions, we are or will be subject to complex environmental, manufacturing, health and\\nsafety laws and regulations at numerous jurisdictional levels in the U.S., China, Germany and other locations abroad, including laws relating to the use,\\nhandling, storage, recycling, disposal and/or human exposure to hazardous materials, product material inputs and post-consumer products and with\\nrespect to constructing, expanding and maintaining our facilities. New, or changes in, environmental and climate change laws, regulations or rules could\\nalso lead to increased costs of compliance, including remediations of any discovered issues, and changes to our operations, which may be significant, and\\nany failures to comply could result in significant expenses, delays or fines. In addition, as we have\\n25\\nTable of Contents\\nincreased our employee headcount and operations, we are and may continue to be subject to increased scrutiny, including litigation and government\\ninvestigations, that we will need to defend against. If we are unable to successfully defend ourselves in such litigation or government investigations, it\\nmay harm our brand, ability to attract and retain qualified employees, business and financial condition. We are also subject to laws and regulations\\napplicable to the supply, manufacture, import, sale, service and performance of our products both domestically and abroad. For example, in countries\\noutside of the U.S., we are required to meet standards relating to vehicle safety, fuel economy and emissions that are often materially different from\\nequivalent requirements in the U.S., thus resulting in additional investment into the vehicles and systems to ensure regulatory compliance in all countries.\\nThis process may include official review and certification of our vehicles by foreign regulatory agencies prior to market entry, as well as compliance with\\nforeign reporting and recall management systems requirements.\\nIn particular, we offer in our vehicles in certain markets Autopilot and FSD Capability features that today assist drivers with certain tedious and\\npotentially dangerous aspects of road travel, but which currently require drivers to remain fully engaged in the driving operation. We are continuing to\\ndevelop our Autopilot and FSD Capability technology. There are a variety of international, federal and state regulations that may apply to, and may\\nadversely affect, the design and performance, sale, marketing, registration and operation of Autopilot and FSD Capability, and future capability, including\\nfull self-driving vehicles that may not be operated by a human driver. This includes many existing vehicle standards that were not originally intended to\\napply to vehicles that may not be operated by a human driver. Such regulations continue to rapidly change, which increases the likelihood of a patchwork\\nof complex or conflicting regulations, or may delay, restrict or prohibit the availability of certain functionalities and vehicle designs, which could adversely\\naffect our business.\\nFinally, as a manufacturer, installer and service provider with respect to solar generation and energy storage systems, a supplier of electricity\\ngenerated and stored by certain of the solar energy and energy storage systems we install for customers, and a provider of grid services through virtual\\npower plant models, we are impacted by federal, state and local regulations and policies concerning the import or export of components, electricity\\npricing, the interconnection of electricity generation and storage equipment with the electrical grid and the sale of electricity generated by third party-\\nowned systems. If regulations and policies are introduced that adversely impact the import or export of components, or the interconnection, maintenance\\nor use of our solar and energy storage systems, they could deter potential customers from purchasing our solar and energy storage products and\\nservices, threaten the economics of our existing contracts and cause us to cease solar and energy storage system sales and services in the relevant\\njurisdictions, which may harm our business, financial condition and operating results.\\nAny failure by us to comply with a variety of U.S. and international privacy and consumer protection laws may harm us.\\nAny failure by us or our vendors or other business partners to comply with our public privacy notice or with federal, state or international privacy,\\ndata protection or security laws or regulations relating to the processing, collection, use, retention, security and transfer of personally identifiable\\ninformation could result in regulatory or litigation-related actions against us, legal liability, fines, damages, ongoing audit requirements and other\\nsignificant costs. Substantial expenses and operational changes may be required in connection with maintaining compliance with such laws, and even an\\nunsuccessful challenge by customers or regulatory authorities of our activities could result in adverse publicity and could require a costly response from\\nand defense by us. In addition, certain privacy laws are still subject to a high degree of uncertainty as to their interpretation, application and impact, and\\nmay require extensive system and operational changes, be difficult to implement, increase our operating costs, adversely impact the cost or\\nattractiveness of the products or services we offer, or result in adverse publicity and harm our reputation. For example, the General Data Protection\\nRegulation applies to the processing of personal information collected from individuals located in the European Union requiring certain data protection\\nmeasures when handling, with a significant risk of fines for noncompliance. Similarly, our North American operations are subject to complex and changing\\nfederal and US state-specific data privacy laws and regulations, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act which imposes certain legal obligations on\\nour use and processing of personal information related to California residents. Finally, additional privacy and cybersecurity laws have come into effect in\\nChina.\\nThese laws continue to develop and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Complying with emerging and changing requirements may\\ncause us to incur substantial costs and make enhancements to relevant data practices. Noncompliance could result in significant penalties or legal\\nliability.\\nIn addition to the risks related to general privacy regulation, we may also be subject to specific vehicle manufacturer obligations relating to\\ncybersecurity, data privacy and data localization requirements which place additional risks to our international operations. Risks and penalties could\\ninclude ongoing audit requirements, data protection\\n26\\nTable of Contents\\nauthority investigations, legal proceedings by international governmental entities or others resulting in mandated disclosure of sensitive data or other\\ncommercially unfavorable terms. Notwithstanding our efforts to protect the security and integrity of our customers’ personal information, we may be\\nrequired to expend significant resources to comply with data breach requirements if, for example, third parties improperly obtain and use the personal\\ninformation of our customers or we otherwise experience a data loss with respect to the personal information we process and handle. A major breach of\\nour network security and systems may occur despite defensive measures, and may result in fines, penalties and damages and harm our brand, prospects\\nand operating results.\\nWe could be subject to liability, penalties and other restrictive sanctions and adverse consequences arising out of certain\\ngovernmental investigations and proceedings.\\nWe are cooperating with certain government investigations as discussed in Note 15, Commitments and Contingencies, to the consolidated financial\\nstatements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. To our knowledge, no government agency in any such ongoing investigation has\\nconcluded that any wrongdoing occurred. However, we cannot predict the outcome or impact of any such ongoing matters, and there exists the possibility\\nthat we could be subject to liability, penalties and other restrictive sanctions and adverse consequences if the SEC, the U.S. Department of Justice or any\\nother government agency were to pursue legal action in the future. Moreover, we expect to incur costs in responding to related requests for information\\nand subpoenas, and if instituted, in defending against any governmental proceedings.\\nWe may face regulatory challenges to or limitations on our ability to sell vehicles directly.\\nWhile we intend to continue to leverage our most effective sales strategies, including sales through our website, we may not be able to sell our\\nvehicles through our own stores in certain states in the U.S. with laws that may be interpreted to impose limitations on this direct-to-consumer sales\\nmodel. It has also been asserted that the laws in some states limit our ability to obtain dealer licenses from state motor vehicle regulators, and such\\nassertions persist. In certain locations, decisions by regulators permitting us to sell vehicles have been, and may be, challenged by dealer associations\\nand others as to whether such decisions comply with applicable state motor vehicle industry laws. We have prevailed in many of these lawsuits and such\\nresults have reinforced our continuing belief that state franchise laws were not intended to apply to a manufacturer that does not have franchise dealers\\nanywhere in the world. In some states, there have also been regulatory and legislative efforts by dealer associations to propose laws that, if enacted,\\nwould prevent us from obtaining dealer licenses in their states given our current sales model. A few states have passed legislation that clarifies our ability\\nto operate, but at the same time limits the number of dealer licenses we can obtain or stores that we can operate. The application of state laws applicable\\nto our operations continues to be difficult to predict.\\nInternationally, there may be laws in jurisdictions we have not yet entered or laws we are unaware of in jurisdictions we have entered that may\\nrestrict our sales or other business practices. Even for those jurisdictions we have analyzed, the laws in this area can be complex, difficult to interpret and\\nmay change over time. Continued regulatory limitations and other obstacles interfering with our ability to sell vehicles directly to consumers may harm\\nour financial condition and operating results.\\nRisks Related to the Ownership of Our Common Stock\\nThe trading price of our common stock is likely to continue to be volatile.\\nThe trading price of our common stock has been highly volatile and could continue to be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors,\\nsome of which are beyond our control. Our common stock has experienced over the last 52 weeks an intra-day trading high of $299.29 per share and a\\nlow of $152.37 per share. The stock market in general, and the market for technology companies in particular, has experienced extreme price and volume\\nfluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. In particular, a large proportion of our\\ncommon stock has been historically and may in the future be traded by short sellers which may put pressure on the supply and demand for our common\\nstock, further influencing volatility in its market price. Public perception of our company or management and other factors outside of our control may\\nadditionally impact the stock price of companies like us that garner a disproportionate degree of public attention, regardless of actual operating\\nperformance. In addition, in the past, following periods of volatility in the overall market or the market price of our shares, securities class action litigation\\nhas been filed against us. While we defend such actions vigorously, any judgment against us or any future stockholder litigation could result in substantial\\ncosts and a diversion of our management’s attention and resources.\\n27\\nTable of Contents\\nOur financial results may vary significantly from period to period due to fluctuations in our operating costs and other factors.\\nWe expect our period-to-period financial results to vary based on our operating costs, which we anticipate will fluctuate as the pace at which we\\ncontinue to design, develop and manufacture new products and increase production capacity by expanding our current manufacturing facilities and\\nadding future facilities, may not be consistent or linear between periods. Additionally, our revenues from period to period may fluctuate as we introduce\\nexisting products to new markets for the first time and as we develop and introduce new products. As a result of these factors, we believe that quarter-to-\\nquarter comparisons of our financial results, especially in the short term, are not necessarily meaningful and that these comparisons cannot be relied\\nupon as indicators of future performance. Moreover, our financial results may not meet expectations of equity research analysts, ratings agencies or\\ninvestors, who may be focused only on short-term quarterly financial results. If any of this occurs, the trading price of our stock could fall substantially,\\neither suddenly or over time.\\nWe may fail to meet our publicly announced guidance or other expectations about our business, which could cause our stock price\\nto decline.\\nWe provide from time to time guidance regarding our expected financial and business performance. Correctly identifying key factors affecting\\nbusiness conditions and predicting future events is inherently an uncertain process, and our guidance may not ultimately be accurate and has in the past\\nbeen inaccurate in certain respects, such as the timing of new product manufacturing ramps. Our guidance is based on certain assumptions such as those\\nrelating to anticipated production and sales volumes (which generally are not linear throughout a given period), average sales prices, supplier and\\ncommodity costs and planned cost reductions. If our guidance varies from actual results, such as due to our assumptions not being met or the impact on\\nour financial performance that could occur as a result of various risks and uncertainties, the market value of our common stock could decline significantly.\\nIf Elon Musk were forced to sell shares of our common stock, either that he has pledged to secure certain personal loan obligations,\\nor in satisfaction of other obligations, such sales could cause our stock price to decline.\\nCertain banking institutions have made extensions of credit to Elon Musk, our Chief Executive Officer, a portion of which was used to purchase\\nshares of common stock in certain of our public offerings and private placements at the same prices offered to third-party participants in such offerings\\nand placements. We are not a party to these loans, which are partially secured by pledges of a portion of the Tesla common stock currently owned by Mr.\\nMusk. If the price of our common stock were to decline substantially, Mr. Musk may be forced by one or more of the banking institutions to sell shares of\\nTesla common stock to satisfy his loan obligations if he could not do so through other means. Any such sales could cause the price of our common stock\\nto decline further. Further, Mr. Musk from time to time may commit to investing in significant business or other ventures, and as a result, be required to\\nsell shares of our common stock in satisfaction of such commitments.\\nAnti-takeover provisions contained in our governing documents, applicable laws and our convertible senior notes could impair a\\ntakeover attempt.\\nOur certificate of incorporation and bylaws afford certain rights and powers to our board of directors that may facilitate the delay or prevention of an\\nacquisition that it deems undesirable. We are also subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law and other provisions of Delaware law\\nthat limit the ability of stockholders in certain situations to effect certain business combinations. In addition, the terms of our convertible senior notes may\\nrequire us to repurchase such notes in the event of a fundamental change, including a takeover of our company. Any of the foregoing provisions and\\nterms that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares\\nof our common stock, and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock.\\nITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS\\nNone.\\n28\\nITEM 1C. CYBERSECURITY\\nCybersecurity Risk Management and Strategy\\nWe recognize the importance of assessing, identifying, and managing material risks associated with cybersecurity threats, as such term is defined in\\nItem 106(a) of Regulation S-K. These risks include, among other things: operational risks, intellectual property theft, fraud, extortion, harm to employees\\nor customers and violation of data privacy or security laws.\\nIdentifying and assessing cybersecurity risk is integrated into our overall risk management systems and processes. Cybersecurity risks related to our\\nbusiness, technical operations, privacy and compliance issues are identified and addressed through a multi-faceted approach including third party\\nassessments, internal IT Audit, IT security, governance, risk and compliance reviews. To defend, detect and respond to cybersecurity incidents, we,\\namong other things: conduct proactive privacy and cybersecurity reviews of systems and applications, audit applicable data policies, perform penetration\\ntesting using external third-party tools and techniques to test security controls, operate a bug bounty program to encourage proactive vulnerability\\nreporting, conduct employee training, monitor emerging laws and regulations related to data protection and information security (including our consumer\\nproducts) and implement appropriate changes.\\nWe have implemented incident response and breach management processes which have four overarching and interconnected stages: 1)\\npreparation for a cybersecurity incident, 2) detection and analysis of a security incident, 3) containment, eradication and recovery, and 4) post-incident\\nanalysis. Such incident responses are overseen by leaders from our Information Security, Product Security, Compliance and Legal teams regarding\\nmatters of cybersecurity.\\nSecurity events and data incidents are evaluated, ranked by severity and prioritized for response and remediation. Incidents are evaluated to\\ndetermine materiality as well as operational and business impact, and reviewed for privacy impact.\\nWe also conduct tabletop exercises to simulate responses to cybersecurity incidents. Our team of cybersecurity professionals then collaborate with\\ntechnical and business stakeholders across our business units to further analyze the risk to the company, and form detection, mitigation and remediation\\nstrategies.\\nAs part of the above processes, we regularly engage external auditors and consultants to assess our internal cybersecurity programs and\\ncompliance with applicable practices and standards. As of 2023, our Information Security Management System has been certified to conform to the\\nrequirements of ISO/IEC 27001:2013.\\nOur risk management program also assesses third party risks, and we perform third-party risk management to identify and mitigate risks from third\\nparties such as vendors, suppliers, and other business partners associated with our use of third-party service providers. Cybersecurity risks are evaluated\\nwhen determining the selection and oversight of applicable third-party service providers and potential fourth-party risks when handling and/or processing\\nour employee, business or customer data. In addition to new vendor onboarding, we perform risk management during third-party cybersecurity\\ncompromise incidents to identify and mitigate risks to us from third-party incidents.\\nWe describe whether and how risks from identified cybersecurity threats, including as a result of any previous cybersecurity incidents, have\\nmaterially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect us, including our business strategy, results of operations, or financial condition, under the\\nheading “Our information technology systems or data, or those of our service providers or customers or users could be subject to cyber-attacks or other\\nsecurity incidents, which could result in data breaches, intellectual property theft, claims, litigation, regulatory investigations, significant liability,\\nreputational damage and other adverse consequences” included as part of our risk factor disclosures at Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\\nCybersecurity Governance\\nCybersecurity is an important part of our risk management processes and an area of focus for our Board and management. Our Audit Committee is\\nresponsible for the oversight of risks from cybersecurity threats. Members of the Audit Committee receive updates on a quarterly basis from senior\\nmanagement, including leaders from our Information Security, Product Security, Compliance and Legal teams regarding matters of cybersecurity. This\\nincludes existing and new cybersecurity risks, status on how management is addressing and/or mitigating those risks, cybersecurity and data privacy\\nincidents (if any) and status on key information security initiatives. Our Board members also engage in ad hoc conversations with management on\\ncybersecurity-related news events and discuss any updates to our cybersecurity risk management and strategy programs.\\n29\\nOur cybersecurity risk management and strategy processes are overseen by leaders from our Information Security, Product Security, Compliance\\nand Legal teams. Such individuals have an average of over 15 years of prior work experience in various roles involving information technology, including\\nsecurity, auditing, compliance, systems and programming. These individuals are informed about, and monitor the prevention, mitigation, detection and\\nremediation of cybersecurity incidents through their management of, and participation in, the cybersecurity risk management and strategy processes\\ndescribed above, including the operation of our incident response plan, and report to the Audit Committee on any appropriate items.\\nITEM 2.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes included\\nelsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. For further discussion of our products and services, technology and competitive strengths, refer to Item 1-\\nBusiness. For discussion related to changes in financial condition and the results of operations for fiscal year 2022-related items, refer to Part II, Item 7.\\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal year 2022, which was\\nfiled with the Securities and Exchange Commission on January 31, 2023.\\nOverview and 2023 Highlights\\nOur mission is to accelerate the world’s transition to sustainable energy. We design, develop, manufacture, lease and sell high-performance fully\\nelectric vehicles, solar energy generation systems and energy storage products. We also offer maintenance, installation, operation, charging, insurance,\\nfinancial and other services related to our products. Additionally, we are increasingly focused on products and services based on artificial intelligence,\\nrobotics and automation.\\nIn 2023, we produced 1,845,985 consumer vehicles and delivered 1,808,581 consumer vehicles. We are currently focused on increasing vehicle\\nproduction, capacity and delivery capabilities, reducing costs, improving and developing our vehicles and battery technologies, vertically integrating and\\nlocalizing our supply chain, improving and further deploying our FSD capabilities, increasing the affordability and efficiency of our vehicles, bringing new\\nproducts to market and expanding our global infrastructure, including our service and charging infrastructure.\\nIn 2023, we deployed 14.72 GWh of energy storage products and 223 megawatts of solar energy systems. We are currently focused on ramping\\nproduction of energy storage products, improving our Solar Roof installation capability and efficiency, and increasing market share of retrofit solar energy\\nsystems.\\nIn 2023, we recognized total revenues of $96.77 billion, representing an increase of $15.31 billion, compared to the prior year. We continue to ramp\\nproduction, build new manufacturing capacity and expand our operations to enable increased deliveries and deployments of our products, and invest in\\nresearch and development to accelerate our AI, software and fleet-based profits for further revenue growth.\\nIn 2023, our net income attributable to common stockholders was $15.00 billion, representing a favorable change of $2.44 billion, compared to the\\nprior year. This included a one-time non-cash tax benefit of $5.93 billion for the release of valuation allowance on certain deferred tax assets. We continue\\nto focus on further cost reductions and operational efficiencies while maximizing delivery volumes.\\nWe ended 2023 with $29.09 billion in cash and cash equivalents and investments, representing an increase of $6.91 billion from the end of 2022.\\nOur cash flows provided by operating activities in 2023 and 2022 were $13.26 billion and $14.72 billion, respectively, representing a decrease of $1.47\\nbillion. Capital expenditures amounted to $8.90 billion in 2023, compared to $7.16 billion in 2022, representing an increase of $1.74 billion. Sustained\\ngrowth has allowed our business to generally fund itself, and we will continue investing in a number of capital-intensive projects and research and\\ndevelopment in upcoming periods.\\n33\\nManagement Opportunities, Challenges and Uncertainties and 2024 Outlook\\nAutomotive—Production\\nThe following is a summary of the status of production of each of our announced vehicle models in production and under development, as of the\\ndate of this Annual Report on Form 10-K:\\nProduction Location\\nVehicle Model(s)\\nProduction Status\\nFremont Factory\\nModel S / Model X\\nActive\\n \\nModel 3 / Model Y\\nActive\\nGigafactory Shanghai\\nModel 3 / Model Y\\nActive\\nGigafactory Berlin-Brandenburg\\nModel Y\\nActive\\nGigafactory Texas\\nModel Y\\nActive\\n \\nCybertruck\\nActive\\nGigafactory Nevada\\nTesla Semi\\nPilot production\\nVarious\\nNext Generation Platform\\nIn development\\nTBD\\nTesla Roadster\\nIn development\\nWe are focused on growing our manufacturing capacity, which includes capacity for manufacturing new vehicle models such as our Cybertruck and\\nnext generation platform, and ramping all of our production vehicles to their installed production capacities as well as increasing production rate and\\nefficiency at our current factories. The next phase of production growth will depend on the continued ramp at our factories and the introduction of our\\nnext generation platform, as well as our ability to add to our available sources of battery cell supply by manufacturing our own cells that we are\\ndeveloping to have high-volume output, lower capital and production costs and longer range. Our goals are to improve vehicle performance, decrease\\nproduction costs and increase affordability and customer awareness.\\nThese plans are subject to uncertainties inherent in establishing and ramping manufacturing operations, which may be exacerbated by new product\\nand manufacturing technologies we introduce, the number of concurrent international projects, any industry-wide component constraints, labor shortages\\nand any future impact from events outside of our control. For example, during the third quarter of 2023, we experienced a sequential decline in\\nproduction volumes due to pre-planned shutdowns for upgrades at various factories. Moreover, we have set ambitious technological targets with our\\nplans for battery cells as well as for iterative manufacturing and design improvements for our vehicles with each new factory.\\nAutomotive—Demand, Sales, Deliveries and Infrastructure\\nOur cost reduction efforts, cost innovation strategies, and additional localized procurement and manufacturing are key to our vehicles’ affordability\\nand have allowed us to competitively price our vehicles. We will also continue to generate demand and brand awareness by improving our vehicles’\\nperformance and functionality, including through products based on artificial intelligence such as Autopilot, FSD Capability, and other software features\\nand delivering new vehicles, such as our Cybertruck. Moreover, we expect to continue to benefit from ongoing electrification of the automotive sector and\\nincreasing environmental regulations and initiatives.\\nHowever, we operate in a cyclical industry that is sensitive to political and regulatory uncertainty, including with respect to trade and the\\nenvironment, all of which can be compounded by inflationary pressures, rising energy prices, interest rate fluctuations and the liquidity of enterprise\\ncustomers. For example, inflationary pressures have increased across the markets in which we operate. In an effort to curb this trend, central banks in\\ndeveloped countries raised interest rates rapidly and substantially, impacting the affordability of vehicle lease and finance arrangements. Further, sales of\\nvehicles in the automotive industry also tend to be cyclical in many markets, which may expose us to increased volatility as we expand and adjust our\\noperations. Moreover, as additional competitors enter the marketplace and help bring the world closer to sustainable transportation, we will have to\\nadjust and continue to execute well to maintain our momentum. Additionally, our suppliers’ liquidity and allocation plans may be affected by current\\nchallenges in the North American automotive industry, which could reduce our access to components or result in unfavorable changes to cost. These\\nmacroeconomic and industry trends have had, and will likely continue to have, an impact on the pricing of, and order rate for our vehicles, and in turn our\\noperating margin. Changes in government and economic incentives in relation to electric vehicles may also impact our sales. We will continue to adjust\\naccordingly to such developments, and we believe our ongoing cost reduction, including improved production innovation and efficiency at our newest\\nfactories and lower logistics costs, and focus on operating leverage will continue to benefit us in relation to our competitors, while our new products will\\nhelp enable future growth.\\n34\\nAs our production increases, we must work constantly to similarly increase vehicle delivery capability so that it does not become a bottleneck on our\\ntotal deliveries. We are also committed to reducing the percentage of vehicles delivered in the third month of each quarter, which will help to reduce the\\ncost per vehicle. As we expand our manufacturing operations globally, we will also have to continue to increase and staff our delivery, servicing and\\ncharging infrastructure accordingly, maintain our vehicle reliability and optimize our Supercharger locations to ensure cost effectiveness and customer\\nsatisfaction. In particular, as other automotive manufacturers have announced their adoption of the North American Charging Standard (“NACS”) and\\nagreements with us to utilize our Superchargers, we must correspondingly expand our network in order to ensure adequate availability to meet customer\\ndemands. We also remain focused on continued enhancements of the capability and efficiency of our servicing operations.\\nEnergy Generation and Storage Demand, Production and Deployment\\nThe long-term success of this business is dependent upon increasing margins through greater volumes. We continue to increase the production of\\nour energy storage products to meet high levels of demand, including the construction of a new Megafactory in Shanghai and the ongoing ramp at our\\nMegafactory in Lathrop, California. For Megapack, energy storage deployments can vary meaningfully quarter to quarter depending on the timing of\\nspecific project milestones. We remain committed to growing our retrofit solar energy business by offering a low-cost and simplified online ordering\\nexperience. In addition, we continue to seek to improve our installation capabilities and price efficiencies for Solar Roof. As these product lines grow, we\\nwill have to maintain adequate battery cell supply for our energy storage products and ensure the availability of qualified personnel, particularly skilled\\nelectricians, to support the ramp of Solar Roof.\\nCash Flow and Capital Expenditure Trends\\nOur capital expenditures are typically difficult to project beyond the short-term given the number and breadth of our core projects at any given time,\\nand may further be impacted by uncertainties in future global market conditions. We are simultaneously ramping new products, building or ramping\\nmanufacturing facilities on three continents, piloting the development and manufacture of new battery cell technologies, expanding our Supercharger\\nnetwork and investing in autonomy and other artificial intelligence enabled training and products, and the pace of our capital spend may vary depending\\non overall priority among projects, the pace at which we meet milestones, production adjustments to and among our various products, increased capital\\nefficiencies and the addition of new projects. Owing and subject to the foregoing as well as the pipeline of announced projects under development, all\\nother continuing infrastructure growth and varying levels of inflation, we currently expect our capital expenditures to exceed $10.00 billion in 2024 and be\\nbetween $8.00 to $10.00 billion in each of the following two fiscal years.\\nOur business has been consistently generating cash flow from operations in excess of our level of capital spend, and with better working capital\\nmanagement resulting in shorter days sales outstanding than days payable outstanding, our sales growth is also generally facilitating positive cash\\ngeneration. We have and will continue to utilize such cash flows, among other things, to do more vertical integration, expand our product roadmap and\\nprovide financing options to our customers. At the same time, we are likely to see heightened levels of capital expenditures during certain periods\\ndepending on the specific pace of our capital-intensive projects and other potential variables such as rising material prices and increases in supply chain\\nand labor expenses resulting from changes in global trade conditions and labor availability. Overall, we expect our ability to be self-funding to continue as\\nlong as macroeconomic factors support current trends in our sales.\\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\\nThe consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (“GAAP”). The\\npreparation of the consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities,\\nrevenues, costs and expenses and related disclosures. We base our estimates on historical experience, as appropriate, and on various other assumptions\\nthat we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Changes in the accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period.\\nAccordingly, actual results could differ significantly from the estimates made by our management. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an\\nongoing basis. To the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results, our future financial statement presentation,\\nfinancial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be affected.\\n35\\nThe estimates used for, but not limited to, determining significant economic incentive for resale value guarantee arrangements, sales return\\nreserves, the collectability of accounts and financing receivables, inventory valuation, warranties, fair value of long-lived assets, goodwill, fair value of\\nfinancial instruments, fair value and residual value of operating lease vehicles and solar energy systems subject to leases could be impacted. We have\\nassessed the impact and are not aware of any specific events or circumstances that required an update to our estimates and assumptions or materially\\naffected the carrying value of our assets or liabilities as of the date of issuance of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. These estimates may change as new\\nevents occur and additional information is obtained. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\\nRevenue Recognition\\nAutomotive Sales\\nAutomotive sales revenue includes revenues related to cash and financing deliveries of new vehicles, and specific other features and services that\\nmeet the definition of a performance obligation under Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (“ASC\\n606”), including access to our FSD Capability features and their ongoing maintenance, internet connectivity, free Supercharging programs and over-the-\\nair software updates. We recognize revenue on automotive sales upon delivery to the customer, which is when the control of a vehicle transfers.\\nPayments are typically received at the point control transfers or in accordance with payment terms customary to the business, except sales we finance for\\nwhich payments are collected over the contractual loan term. We also recognize a sales return reserve based on historical experience plus consideration\\nfor expected future market values, when we offer resale value guarantees or similar buyback terms. Other features and services such as access to our\\ninternet connectivity, unlimited free Supercharging and over-the-air software updates are provisioned upon control transfer of a vehicle and recognized\\nover time on a straight-line basis as we have a stand-ready obligation to deliver such services to the customer. Other limited free Supercharging\\nincentives are recognized based on actual usage or expiration, whichever is earlier. We recognize revenue related to these other features and services\\nover the performance period, which is generally the expected ownership life of the vehicle. Revenue related to FSD Capability features is recognized when\\nfunctionality is delivered to the customer and their ongoing maintenance is recognized over time. For our obligations related to automotive sales, we\\nestimate standalone selling price by considering costs used to develop and deliver the service, third-party pricing of similar options and other information\\nthat may be available.\\nInventory Valuation\\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is computed using standard cost for vehicles and energy products, which\\napproximates actual cost on a first-in, first-out basis. We record inventory write-downs for excess or obsolete inventories based upon assumptions about\\ncurrent and future demand forecasts. If our inventory on-hand is in excess of our future demand forecast, the excess amounts are written-off.\\nWe also review our inventory to determine whether its carrying value exceeds the net amount realizable upon the ultimate sale of the inventory.\\nThis requires us to determine the estimated selling price of our vehicles less the estimated cost to convert the inventory on-hand into a finished product.\\nOnce inventory is written-down, a new, lower cost basis for that inventory is established and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result\\nin the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis.\\nShould our estimates of future selling prices or production costs change, additional and potentially material write-downs may be required. A small\\nchange in our estimates may result in a material charge to our reported financial results.\\n36\\nWarranties\\nWe provide a manufacturer’s warranty on all new and used vehicles and a warranty on the installation and components of the energy generation\\nand storage systems we sell for periods typically between 10 to 25 years. We accrue a warranty reserve for the products sold by us, which includes our\\nbest estimate of the projected costs to repair or replace items under warranties and recalls if identified. These estimates are based on actual claims\\nincurred to date and an estimate of the nature, frequency and costs of future claims. These estimates are inherently uncertain and changes to our\\nhistorical or projected warranty experience may cause material changes to the warranty reserve in the future. The warranty reserve does not include\\nprojected warranty costs associated with our vehicles subject to operating lease accounting and our solar energy systems under lease contracts or PPAs,\\nas the costs to repair these warranty claims are expensed as incurred. The portion of the warranty reserve expected to be incurred within the next 12\\nmonths is included within Accrued liabilities and other, while the remaining balance is included within Other long-term liabilities on the consolidated\\nbalance sheets. For liabilities that we are entitled to receive indemnification from our suppliers, we record receivables for the contractually obligated\\namounts on the consolidated balance sheets as a component of Prepaid expenses and other current assets for the current portion and as Other non-\\ncurrent assets for the long-term portion. Warranty expense is recorded as a component of Cost of revenues in the consolidated statements of operations.\\nDue to the magnitude of our automotive business, our accrued warranty balance is primarily related to our automotive segment.\\nStock-Based Compensation\\nWe use the fair value method of accounting for our stock options and restricted stock units (“RSUs”) granted to employees and for our employee\\nstock purchase plan (the “ESPP”) to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for the stock-based awards. The fair value of stock\\noption awards with only service and/or performance conditions is estimated on the grant or offering date using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model.\\nThe Black-Scholes option-pricing model requires inputs such as the risk-free interest rate, expected term and expected volatility. These inputs are\\nsubjective and generally require significant judgment. The fair value of RSUs is measured on the grant date based on the closing fair market value of our\\ncommon stock. The resulting cost is recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the awards,\\nusually the vesting period, which is generally four years for stock options and RSUs and six months for the ESPP. Stock-based compensation expense is\\nrecognized on a straight-line basis, net of actual forfeitures in the period.\\nFor performance-based awards, stock-based compensation expense is recognized over the expected performance achievement period of individual\\nperformance milestones when the achievement of each individual performance milestone becomes probable.\\nAs we accumulate additional employee stock-based awards data over time and as we incorporate market data related to our common stock, we may\\ncalculate significantly different volatilities and expected lives, which could materially impact the valuation of our stock-based awards and the stock-based\\ncompensation expense that we will recognize in future periods. Stock-based compensation expense is recorded in Cost of revenues, Research and\\ndevelopment expense and Selling, general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of operations.\\nIncome Taxes\\nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and in many foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our provision for\\nincome taxes, our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets that are not more likely\\nthan not to be realized. We monitor the realizability of our deferred tax assets taking into account all relevant factors at each reporting period. In\\ncompleting our assessment of realizability of our deferred tax assets, we consider our history of income (loss) measured at pre-tax income (loss) adjusted\\nfor permanent book-tax differences on a jurisdictional basis, volatility in actual earnings, excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation in\\nrecent prior years, and impacts of the timing of reversal of existing temporary differences. We also rely on our assessment of the Company’s projected\\nfuture results of business operations, including uncertainty in future operating results relative to historical results, volatility in the market price of our\\ncommon stock and its performance over time, variable macroeconomic conditions impacting our ability to forecast future taxable income, and changes in\\nbusiness that may affect the existence and magnitude of future taxable income. Our valuation allowance assessment is based on our best estimate of\\nfuture results considering all available information.\\n37\\nFurthermore, significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions. In the ordinary course of business, there are many transactions and\\ncalculations for which the ultimate tax settlement is uncertain. As a result, we recognize the effect of this uncertainty on our tax attributes or taxes\\npayable based on our estimates of the eventual outcome. These effects are recognized when, despite our belief that our tax return positions are\\nsupportable, we believe that it is more likely than not that some of those positions may not be fully sustained upon review by tax authorities. We are\\nrequired to file income tax returns in the U.S. and various foreign jurisdictions, which requires us to interpret the applicable tax laws and regulations in\\neffect in such jurisdictions. Such returns are subject to audit by the various federal, state and foreign taxing authorities, who may disagree with respect to\\nour tax positions. We believe that our consideration is adequate for all open audit years based on our assessment of many factors, including past\\nexperience and interpretations of tax law. We review and update our estimates in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax\\naudit, the lapse of a statute of limitations or a change in estimate. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters differs from our expectations,\\nsuch differences may impact income tax expense in the period in which such determination is made.\\nResults of Operations\\nRevenues\\n \\nYear Ended December 31,\\n2023 vs. 2022 Change\\n2022 vs. 2021 Change\\n(Dollars in millions)\\n2023\\n2022\\n2021\\n$\\n%\\n$\\n%\\nAutomotive sales\\n$\\n78,509 \\n$\\n67,210 \\n$\\n44,125 \\n$\\n11,299 \\n17 %\\n$\\n23,085 \\n52 %\\nAutomotive regulatory credits\\n1,790 \\n1,776 \\n1,465 \\n14 \\n1 %\\n311 \\n21 %\\nAutomotive leasing\\n2,120 \\n2,476 \\n1,642 \\n(356)\\n(14)%\\n834 \\n51 %\\nTotal automotive revenues\\n82,419 \\n71,462 \\n47,232 \\n10,957 \\n15 %\\n24,230 \\n51 %\\nServices and other\\n8,319 \\n6,091 \\n3,802 \\n2,228 \\n37 %\\n2,289 \\n60 %\\nTotal automotive & services and other segment\\nrevenue\\n90,738 \\n77,553 \\n51,034 \\n13,185 \\n17 %\\n26,519 \\n52 %\\nEnergy generation and storage segment revenue\\n6,035 \\n3,909 \\n2,789 \\n2,126 \\n54 %\\n1,120 \\n40 %\\nTotal revenues\\n$\\n96,773 \\n$\\n81,462 \\n$\\n53,823 \\n$\\n15,311 \\n19 %\\n$\\n27,639 \\n51 %\\nAutomotive & Services and Other Segment\\nAutomotive sales revenue includes revenues related to cash and financing deliveries of new Model S, Model X, Semi, Model 3, Model Y, and\\nCybertruck vehicles, including access to our FSD Capability features and their ongoing maintenance, internet connectivity, free Supercharging programs\\nand over-the-air software updates. These deliveries are vehicles that are not subject to lease accounting.\\nAutomotive regulatory credits includes sales of regulatory credits to other automotive manufacturers. Our revenue from automotive regulatory\\ncredits is directly related to our new vehicle production, sales and pricing negotiated with our customers. We monetize them proactively as new vehicles\\nare sold based on standing arrangements with buyers of such credits, typically as close as possible to the production and delivery of the vehicle or\\nchanges in regulation impacting the credits.\\nAutomotive leasing revenue includes the amortization of revenue for vehicles under direct operating lease agreements.

Cost of automotive sales revenue increased in line with the change in deliveries year over year, as discussed above. The increase\\nwas partially offset by a decrease in the average combined cost per unit of our vehicles primarily due to sales mix, lower inbound freight, a decrease in\\nmaterial costs and lower manufacturing costs from better fixed cost absorption. Our costs of revenue were also positively impacted by the United States\\ndollar strengthening against our foreign currencies as compared to the prior periods and by the IRA manufacturing credits earned during the current year.\\nCost of automotive leasing revenue decreased $241 million, or 16%, in the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to the year ended\\nDecember 31, 2022. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in direct sales-type leasing cost of revenue driven by lower deliveries year over year.\\nCost of services and other revenue increased $1.95 billion, or 33%, in the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to the year ended\\nDecember 31, 2022.

The decrease was primarily due to a lower average selling price on our vehicles partially offset by the favorable change in our\\naverage combined cost per unit of our vehicles and IRA manufacturing credits earned as discussed above.\\nGross margin for total automotive & services and other segment decreased from 26.5% to 18.2% in the year ended December 31, 2023 as\\ncompared to the year ended December 31, 2022, primarily due to the automotive gross margin decrease discussed above.\\nEnergy Generation and Storage Segment\\nCost of energy generation and storage revenue includes direct and indirect material and labor costs, warehouse rent, freight, warranty expense,\\nother overhead costs and amortization of certain acquired intangible assets. Cost of energy generation and storage revenue also includes charges to write\\ndown the carrying value of our inventory when it exceeds its estimated net realizable value and to provide for obsolete and on-hand inventory in excess\\nof forecasted demand. Additionally, cost of energy generation and storage revenue benefits from manufacturing credits earned. In agreements for solar\\nenergy systems and PPAs where we are the lessor, the cost of revenue is primarily comprised of depreciation of the cost of leased solar energy systems,\\nmaintenance costs associated with those systems and amortization of any initial direct costs.\\n2023 compared to 2022\\nCost of energy generation and storage revenue increased $1.27 billion, or 35%, in the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to the year\\nended December 31, 2022, in line with the increase in Megapack deployments year over year, as discussed above. This increase was partially offset by an\\nimprovement in production ramping that drove down the average cost per MWh of Megapack as well as IRA manufacturing credits earned during the\\ncurrent year.\\n40\\nGross margin for energy generation and storage increased from 7.4% to 18.9% in the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to the year\\nended December 31, 2022. The increase was driven by an improvement in our Megapack gross margin from lower average cost per MWh and a higher\\nproportion of Megapack, which operated at a higher gross margin, within the segment as compared to the prior year periods.

As of December 31, 2023,\\nbased on the relevant weight of positive and negative evidence, including the amount of our taxable income in recent years which is objective and\\nverifiable, and consideration of our expected future taxable earnings, we concluded that it is more likely than not that our U.S. federal and certain state\\ndeferred tax assets are realizable. As such, we released $6.54 billion of our valuation allowance associated with the U.S. federal and state deferred tax\\nassets, with the exception of our California deferred tax assets. Approximately $5.93 billion of the total valuation allowance release was related to\\ndeferred tax assets to be realized in the future years and the remainder benefited us during the year ended December 31, 2023. We continue to maintain\\na full valuation allowance against our California deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2023, because we concluded they are not more likely than not to\\nbe realized as we expect our California deferred tax assets generation in future years to exceed our ability to use these deferred tax assets.\\nOur (benefit from) provision for income taxes changed by $6.13 billion in the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to the year ended\\nDecember 31, 2022, primarily due to the release of $6.54 billion of our valuation allowance associated with the U.S. federal and certain state deferred tax\\nassets.\\nOur effective tax rate changed from an expense of 8% to a benefit of 50% in the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to the year ended\\nDecember 31, 2022, primarily due to the release of the valuation allowance regarding our U.S. federal and certain state deferred tax assets.\\nSee Note 14, Income Taxes, to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details.\\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\\nWe expect to continue to generate net positive operating cash flow as we have done in the last five fiscal years. The cash we generate from our core\\noperations enables us to fund ongoing operations and production, our research and development projects for new products and technologies including our\\nproprietary battery cells, additional manufacturing ramps at existing manufacturing facilities, the construction of future factories, and the continued\\nexpansion of our retail and service locations, body shops, Mobile Service fleet, Supercharger, including to support NACS, energy product installation\\ncapabilities and autonomy and other artificial intelligence enabled products.\\n42\\nIn addition, because a large portion of our future expenditures will be to fund our growth, we expect that if needed we will be able to adjust our\\ncapital and operating expenditures by operating segment. For example, if our near-term manufacturing operations decrease in scale or ramp more slowly\\nthan expected, including due to global economic or business conditions, we may choose to correspondingly slow the pace of our capital expenditures.\\nFinally, we continually evaluate our cash needs and may decide it is best to raise additional capital or seek alternative financing sources to fund the rapid\\ngrowth of our business, including through drawdowns on existing or new debt facilities or financing funds. Conversely, we may also from time to time\\ndetermine that it is in our best interests to voluntarily repay certain indebtedness early.\\nAccordingly, we believe that our current sources of funds will provide us with adequate liquidity during the 12-month period following December 31,\\n2023, as well as in the long-term.\\nSee the sections below for more details regarding the material requirements for cash in our business and our sources of liquidity to meet such\\nneeds.\\nMaterial Cash Requirements\\nFrom time to time in the ordinary course of business, we enter into agreements with vendors for the purchase of components and raw materials to\\nbe used in the manufacture of our products. However, due to contractual terms, variability in the precise growth curves of our development and\\nproduction ramps, and opportunities to renegotiate pricing, we generally do not have binding and enforceable purchase orders under such contracts\\nbeyond the short-term, and the timing and magnitude of purchase orders beyond such period is difficult to accurately project.\\nAs discussed in and subject to the considerations referenced in Part II, Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and\\nResults of Operations—Management Opportunities, Challenges and Uncertainties and 2023 Outlook—Cash Flow and Capital Expenditure Trends in this\\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K, we currently expect our capital expenditures to support our projects globally to exceed $10.00 billion in 2024 and be\\nbetween $8.00 to $10.00 billion in each of the following two fiscal years. In connection with our operations at Gigafactory New York, we have an\\nagreement to spend or incur $5.00 billion in combined capital, operational expenses, costs of goods sold and other costs in the State of New York through\\nDecember 31, 2029 (pursuant to a deferral of our required timelines to meet such obligations that was granted in April 2021, and which was memorialized\\nin an amendment to our agreement with the SUNY Foundation in August 2021). For details regarding these obligations, refer to Note 15, Commitments\\nand Contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\\nAs of December 31, 2023, we and our subsidiaries had outstanding $4.68 billion in aggregate principal amount of indebtedness, of which $1.98\\nbillion is scheduled to become due in the succeeding 12 months. As of December 31, 2023, our total minimum lease payments was $5.96 billion, of which\\n$1.31 billion is due in the succeeding 12 months. For details regarding our indebtedness and lease obligations, refer to Note 11, Debt, and Note 12,\\nLeases, to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\\nSources and Conditions of Liquidity\\nOur sources to fund our material cash requirements are predominantly from our deliveries and servicing of new and used vehicles, sales and\\ninstallations of our energy storage products and solar energy systems, proceeds from debt facilities and proceeds from equity offerings, when applicable.\\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had $16.40 billion and $12.70 billion of cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments, respectively. Balances\\nheld in foreign currencies had a U.S. dollar equivalent of $4.43 billion and consisted primarily of Chinese yuan and euros. We had $5.03 billion of unused\\ncommitted credit amounts as of December 31, 2023. For details regarding our indebtedness, refer to Note 11, Debt, to the consolidated financial\\nstatements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\\nWe continue adapting our strategy to meet our liquidity and risk objectives, such as investing in U.S. government securities and other investments,\\nto do more vertical integration, expand our product roadmap and provide financing options to our customers.\\n43\\nSummary of Cash Flows\\n \\nYear Ended December 31,\\n(Dollars in millions)\\n2023\\n2022\\n2021\\nNet cash provided by operating activities\\n$\\n13,256 \\n$\\n14,724 \\n$\\n11,497 \\nNet cash used in investing activities\\n$\\n(15,584)\\n$\\n(11,973)\\n$\\n(7,868)\\nNet cash provided by (used in) financing activities\\n$\\n2,589 \\n$\\n(3,527)\\n$\\n(5,203)\\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\\nOur cash flows from operating activities are significantly affected by our cash investments to support the growth of our business in areas such as\\nresearch and development and selling, general and administrative and working capital. Our operating cash inflows include cash from vehicle sales and\\nrelated servicing, customer lease and financing payments, customer deposits, cash from sales of regulatory credits and energy generation and storage\\nproducts, and interest income on our cash and investments portfolio. These cash inflows are offset by our payments to suppliers for production materials\\nand parts used in our manufacturing process, operating expenses, operating lease payments and interest payments on our financings.\\nNet cash provided by operating activities decreased by $1.47 billion to $13.26 billion during the year ended December 31, 2023 from $14.72 billion\\nduring the year ended December 31, 2022. This decrease was primarily due to the decrease in net income excluding non-cash expenses, gains and losses\\nof $2.93 billion, partially offset by favorable changes in net operating assets and liabilities of $1.46 billion.\\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\\nCash flows from investing activities and their variability across each period related primarily to capital expenditures, which were $8.90 billion for the\\nyear ended December 31, 2023 and $7.16 billion for the year ended December 31, 2022, mainly for global factory expansion and machinery and\\nequipment as we expand our product roadmap. We also purchased $6.62 billion and $5.81 billion of investments, net of proceeds from maturities and\\nsales, for the year ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Additionally, proceeds from sales of digital assets was $936 million in the year\\nended December 31, 2022.\\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\\nNet cash from financing activities changed by $6.12 billion to $2.59 billion net cash provided by financing activities during the year ended\\nDecember 31, 2023 from $3.53 billion net cash used in financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2022. The change was primarily due to a\\n$3.93 billion increase in proceeds from issuances of debt and a $2.01 billion decrease in repayments of debt. See Note 11, Debt, to the consolidated\\nfinancial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details regarding our debt obligations.\\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\\nSee Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form\\n10-K.\\n44\\nITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\\nForeign Currency Risk\\nWe transact business globally in multiple currencies and hence have foreign currency risks related to our revenue, costs of revenue and operating\\nexpenses denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar (primarily the Chinese yuan and euro in relation to our current year operations). In general,\\nwe are a net receiver of currencies other than the U.S. dollar for our foreign subsidiaries. Accordingly, changes in exchange rates affect our operating\\nresults as expressed in U.S. dollars as we do not typically hedge foreign currency risk.\\nWe have also experienced, and will continue to experience, fluctuations in our net income as a result of gains (losses) on the settlement and the re-\\nmeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies that are not the local currency (primarily consisting of our intercompany and\\ncash and cash equivalents balances).\\nWe considered the historical trends in foreign currency exchange rates and determined that it is reasonably possible that adverse changes in foreign\\ncurrency exchange rates of 10% for all currencies could be experienced in the near-term. These changes were applied to our total monetary assets and\\nliabilities denominated in currencies other than our local currencies at the balance sheet date to compute the impact these changes would have had on\\nour net income before income taxes. These changes would have resulted in a gain or loss of $1.01 billion at December 31, 2023 and $473 million at\\nDecember 31, 2022, assuming no foreign currency hedging.\\n45\\nITEM 8.

We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in\\nInternal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).\\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of\\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023 in\\nconformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material\\nrespects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated\\nFramework (2013) issued by the COSO.\\nChanges in Accounting Principles\\nAs discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed the manner in which it accounts for convertible debt in 2021.\\nBasis for Opinions\\nThe Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting,\\nand for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial\\nReporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's\\ninternal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight\\nBoard (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and\\nthe applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain\\nreasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether\\neffective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated\\nfinancial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a\\ntest basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting\\nprinciples used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements.\\nOur audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk\\nthat a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our\\naudits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable\\nbasis for our opinions.\\n47\\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting\\nand the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal\\ncontrol over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately\\nand fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as\\nnecessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures\\nof the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable\\nassurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material\\neffect on the financial statements.\\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation\\nof effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of\\ncompliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\\nCritical Audit Matters\\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was\\ncommunicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated\\nfinancial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not\\nalter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below,\\nproviding a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\\nAutomotive Warranty Reserve\\nAs described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, total accrued warranty, which primarily relates to the automotive segment, was $5,152\\nmillion as of December 31, 2023. The Company provides a manufacturer’s warranty on all new and used Tesla vehicles. A warranty reserve is accrued for\\nthese products sold, which includes management’s best estimate of the projected costs to repair or replace items under warranty and recalls if identified.\\nThese estimates are based on actual claims incurred to date and an estimate of the nature, frequency and costs of future claims.\\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the automotive warranty reserve is a critical audit matter are\\nthe significant judgment by management in determining the automotive warranty reserve for certain Tesla vehicle models; this in turn led to significant\\nauditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures to evaluate management’s significant assumptions related to the nature, frequency\\nand costs of future claims for certain Tesla vehicle models, and the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.\\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated\\nfinancial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management’s estimate of the automotive warranty\\nreserve for certain Tesla vehicle models, including controls over management’s significant assumptions related to the nature, frequency and costs of\\nfuture claims as well as the completeness and accuracy of actual claims incurred to date. These procedures also included, among others, performing one\\nof the following: (i) testing management’s process for determining the automotive warranty reserve for certain Tesla vehicle models or (ii) developing an\\nindependent estimate of the automotive warranty reserve for certain Tesla vehicle models and comparing the independent estimate to management’s\\nestimate to evaluate the reasonableness of the estimate. Testing management’s process involved evaluating the reasonableness of significant\\nassumptions related to the nature and frequency of future claims and the related costs to repair or replace items under warranty. Evaluating the\\nassumptions related to the nature and frequency of future claims and the related costs to repair or replace items under warranty involved evaluating\\nwhether the assumptions used were reasonable by performing a lookback analysis comparing prior period forecasted claims to actual claims incurred.\\nDeveloping the independent estimate involved testing the completeness and accuracy of historical vehicle claims processed and testing that such claims\\nwere appropriately used by management in the estimation of future claims. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in\\ndeveloping an independent estimate of the automotive warranty reserve for certain Tesla vehicle models and in evaluating the appropriateness of certain\\naspects of management’s significant assumptions related to the nature and frequency of future claims.\\n/s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\\nSan Jose, California\\nJanuary 26,

(“Tesla”, the “Company”, “we”, “us” or “our”) was incorporated in the State of Delaware on July 1, 2003. We design, develop,\\nmanufacture, sell and lease high-performance fully electric vehicles and energy generation and storage systems, and offer services related to our\\nproducts. Our Chief Executive Officer, as the chief operating decision maker (“CODM”), organizes our company, manages resource allocations and\\nmeasures performance among two operating and reportable segments: (i) automotive and (ii) energy generation and storage.\\nNote 2 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\\nPrinciples of Consolidation\\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with GAAP and reflect our accounts and operations and\\nthose of our subsidiaries in which we have a controlling financial interest. In accordance with the provisions of ASC 810, Consolidation (“ASC 810”), we\\nconsolidate any variable interest entity (“VIE”) of which we are the primary beneficiary. We have formed VIEs with financing fund investors in the ordinary\\ncourse of business in order to facilitate the funding and monetization of certain attributes associated with solar energy systems and leases under our\\ndirect vehicle leasing programs. The typical condition for a controlling financial interest ownership is holding a majority of the voting interests of an entity;\\nhowever, a controlling financial interest may also exist in entities, such as VIEs, through arrangements that do not involve controlling voting interests. ASC\\n810 requires a variable interest holder to consolidate a VIE if that party has the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the\\nVIE’s economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses of the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE or the right to receive benefits\\nfrom the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE. We do not consolidate a VIE in which we have a majority ownership interest when we are not\\nconsidered the primary beneficiary. We have determined that we are the primary beneficiary of all the VIEs (see Note 16, Variable Interest Entity\\nArrangements). We evaluate our relationships with all the VIEs on an ongoing basis to ensure that we continue to be the primary beneficiary. All\\nintercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated upon consolidation.\\nUse of Estimates\\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported\\namounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, costs and expenses and related disclosures in the accompanying notes. The estimates used for, but not limited to,\\ndetermining significant economic incentive for resale value guarantee arrangements, sales return reserves, income taxes, the collectability of accounts\\nand finance receivables, inventory valuation, warranties, fair value of long-lived assets, goodwill, fair value of financial instruments, fair value and residual\\nvalue of operating lease vehicles and solar energy systems subject to leases could be impacted. We have assessed the impact and are not aware of any\\nspecific events or circumstances that required an update to our estimates and assumptions or materially affected the carrying value of our assets or\\nliabilities as of the date of issuance of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. These estimates may change as new events occur and additional information is\\nobtained. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\\nReclassifications\\nCertain prior period balances have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation in the consolidated financial statements and the\\naccompanying notes.\\n54\\nRevenue Recognition\\nRevenue by source\\nThe following table disaggregates our revenue by major source (in millions):\\nYear Ended December 31,\\n2023\\n2022\\n2021\\nAutomotive sales\\n$\\n78,509 \\n$\\n67,210 \\n$\\n44,125 \\nAutomotive regulatory credits\\n1,790 \\n1,776 \\n1,465 \\nEnergy generation and storage sales\\n5,515 \\n3,376 \\n2,279 \\nServices and other\\n8,319 \\n6,091 \\n3,802 \\nTotal revenues from sales and services\\n94,133 \\n78,453 \\n51,671 \\nAutomotive leasing\\n2,120 \\n2,476 \\n1,642 \\nEnergy generation and storage leasing\\n520 \\n533 \\n510 \\nTotal revenues\\n$\\n96,773 \\n$\\n81,462 \\n$\\n53,823 \\nAutomotive Segment\\nAutomotive Sales\\nAutomotive sales revenue includes revenues related to cash and financing deliveries of new vehicles, and specific other features and services that\\nmeet the definition of a performance obligation under ASC 606, including access to our FSD Capability features and their ongoing maintenance, internet\\nconnectivity, free Supercharging programs and over-the-air software updates. We recognize revenue on automotive sales upon delivery to the customer,\\nwhich is when the control of a vehicle transfers. Payments are typically received at the point control transfers or in accordance with payment terms\\ncustomary to the business, except sales we finance for which payments are collected over the contractual loan term. We also recognize a sales return\\nreserve based on historical experience plus consideration for expected future market values, when we offer resale value guarantees or similar buyback\\nterms. Other features and services such as access to our internet connectivity, unlimited free Supercharging and over-the-air software updates are\\nprovisioned upon control transfer of a vehicle and recognized over time on a straight-line basis as we have a stand-ready obligation to deliver such\\nservices to the customer. Other limited free Supercharging incentives are recognized based on actual usage or expiration, whichever is earlier. We\\nrecognize revenue related to these other features and services over the performance period, which is generally the expected ownership life of the vehicle.\\nRevenue related to FSD Capability features is recognized when functionality is delivered to the customer and their ongoing maintenance is recognized\\nover time. For our obligations related to automotive sales, we estimate standalone selling price by considering costs used to develop and deliver the\\nservice, third-party pricing of similar options and other information that may be available.\\nAny fees that are paid or payable by us to a customer’s lender when we arrange the financing are recognized as an offset against automotive sales\\nrevenue. Costs to obtain a contract mainly relate to commissions paid to our sales personnel for the sale of vehicles. As our contract costs related to\\nautomotive sales are typically fulfilled within one year, the costs to obtain a contract are expensed as incurred. Amounts billed to customers related to\\nshipping and handling are classified as automotive sales revenue, and we have elected to recognize the cost for freight and shipping when control over\\nvehicles, parts or accessories have transferred to the customer as an expense in cost of automotive sales revenue. Our policy is to exclude taxes\\ncollected from a customer from the transaction price of automotive contracts.\\n55\\nWe offer resale value guarantees to our commercial banking partners in connection with certain vehicle leasing programs. Under these programs,\\nwe originate the lease with our end customer and immediately transfer the lease and the underlying vehicle to our commercial banking partner, with the\\ntransaction being accounted for as a sale under ASC 606. We receive upfront payment for the vehicle, do not bear casualty and credit risks during the\\nlease term, and we provide a guarantee capped to a limit if they are unable to sell the vehicle at or above the vehicle’s contract residual value at the end\\nof the lease term. We estimate a guarantee liability in accordance with ASC 460, Guarantees and record it within other liabilities on our consolidated\\nbalance sheet. On a quarterly basis, we assess the estimated market value of vehicles sold under this program to determine whether there have been\\nchanges to the amount of expected resale value guarantee payments. As we accumulate more data related to the resale values of our vehicles or as\\nmarket conditions change, there may be material changes to their estimated values. The total guarantee liability on vehicles sold under this program was\\nimmaterial as of December 31, 2023.\\nDeferred revenue related to the access to our FSD Capability features and their ongoing maintenance, internet connectivity, free Supercharging\\nprograms and over-the-air software updates primarily on automotive sales consisted of the following (in millions):\\nYear Ended December 31,\\n2023\\n2022\\nDeferred revenue— beginning of period\\n$\\n2,913 \\n$\\n2,382 \\nAdditions\\n1,201 \\n1,178 \\nNet changes in liability for pre-existing contracts\\n17 \\n(67)\\nRevenue recognized\\n(595)\\n(580)\\nDeferred revenue— end of period\\n$\\n3,536 \\n$\\n2,913 \\nDeferred revenue is equivalent to the total transaction price allocated to the performance obligations that are unsatisfied, or partially unsatisfied, as\\nof the balance sheet date. Revenue recognized from the deferred revenue balance as of December 31, 2022 was $469 million for the year ended\\nDecember 31, 2023. We had recognized revenue of $472 million from the deferred revenue balance as of December 31, 2021, for the year ended\\nDecember 31, 2022, primarily related to the general FSD Capability feature release in North America in the fourth quarter of 2022. Of the total deferred\\nrevenue balance as of December 31, 2023, we expect to recognize $926 million of revenue in the next 12 months. The remaining balance will be\\nrecognized at the time of transfer of control of the product or over the performance period as discussed above in Automotive Sales.\\nWe have been providing loans for financing our automotive deliveries in volume since fiscal year 2022. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, we have\\nrecorded net financing receivables on the consolidated balance sheets, of which $242 million and $128 million, respectively, is recorded within Accounts\\nreceivable, net, for the current portion and $1.04 billion and $665 million, respectively, is recorded within Other non-current assets for the long-term\\nportion.\\nAutomotive Regulatory Credits\\nWe earn tradable credits in the operation of our automotive business under various regulations related to ZEVs, greenhouse gas, fuel economy and\\nclean fuel. We sell these credits to other regulated entities who can use the credits to comply with emission standards and other regulatory requirements.\\nPayments for automotive regulatory credits are typically received at the point control transfers to the customer, or in accordance with payment\\nterms customary to the business. We recognize revenue on the sale of automotive regulatory credits, which have negligible incremental costs associated\\nwith them, at the time control of the regulatory credits is transferred to the purchasing party. Deferred revenue related to sales of automotive regulatory\\ncredits was immaterial as of December 31, 2023 and 2022. Revenue recognized from the deferred revenue balance as of December 31, 2022 and 2021\\nwas immaterial for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we had also recognized $288 million in\\nrevenue due to changes in regulation which entitled us to additional consideration for credits sold previously.\\n56\\nAutomotive Leasing Revenue\\nDirect Vehicle Operating Leasing Program\\nWe have outstanding leases under our direct vehicle operating leasing programs in the U.S., Canada and in certain countries in Europe. Qualifying\\ncustomers are permitted to lease a vehicle directly from Tesla for up to 48 months. At the end of the lease term, customers are generally required to\\nreturn the vehicles to us. We account for these leasing transactions as operating leases. We record leasing revenues to automotive leasing revenue on a\\nstraight-line basis over the contractual term, and we record the depreciation of these vehicles to cost of automotive leasing revenue. For the years ended\\nDecember 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, we recognized $1.86 billion, $1.75 billion and $1.25 billion of direct vehicle leasing revenue, respectively. As of\\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022, we had deferred $458 million and $407 million, respectively, of lease-related upfront payments, which will be recognized\\non a straight-line basis over the contractual terms of the individual leases.\\nOur policy is to exclude taxes collected from a customer from the transaction price of automotive contracts.\\nDirect Sales-Type Leasing Program\\nWe have outstanding direct leases and vehicles financed by us under loan arrangements accounted for as sales-type leases under ASC 842, Leases\\n(“ASC 842”), in certain countries in Asia and Europe. Depending on the specific program, customers may or may not have a right to return the vehicle to\\nus during or at the end of the lease term. If the customer does not have a right to return, the customer will take title to the vehicle at the end of the lease\\nterm after making all contractual payments. Under the programs for which there is a right to return, the purchase option is reasonably certain to be\\nexercised by the lessee and we therefore expect the customer to take title to the vehicle at the end of the lease term after making all contractual\\npayments. Our arrangements under these programs can have terms for up to 72 months. We recognize all revenue and costs associated with the sales-\\ntype lease as automotive leasing revenue and automotive leasing cost of revenue, respectively, upon delivery of the vehicle to the customer. Interest\\nincome based on the implicit rate in the lease is recorded to automotive leasing revenue over time as customers are invoiced on a monthly basis. For the\\nyears ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, we recognized $215 million, $683 million and $369 million, respectively, of sales-type leasing revenue\\nand $164 million, $427 million and $234 million, respectively, of sales-type leasing cost of revenue.\\nServices and Other Revenue\\nServices and other revenue consists of sales of used vehicles, non-warranty after-sales vehicle services, body shop and parts, paid Supercharging,\\nvehicle insurance revenue and retail merchandise.\\nRevenues related to repair, maintenance and vehicle insurance services are recognized over time as services are provided and extended service\\nplans are recognized over the performance period of the service contract as the obligation represents a stand-ready obligation to the customer. We sell\\nused vehicles, services, service plans, vehicle components and merchandise separately and thus use standalone selling prices as the basis for revenue\\nallocation to the extent that these items are sold in transactions with other performance obligations. Payment for used vehicles, services, vehicle\\ncomponents, and merchandise are typically received at the point when control transfers to the customer or in accordance with payment terms customary\\nto the business. Payments received for prepaid plans are refundable upon customer cancellation of the related contracts and are included within\\nCustomer deposits on the consolidated balance sheets. We record in Deferred revenue any non-refundable prepayment amounts that are collected from\\ncustomers and unearned insurance premiums, which is recognized as revenue ratably over the respective customer contract term. Deferred revenue\\nexcluding unearned insurance premiums was immaterial as of December 31, 2023 and 2022.\\n57\\nEnergy Generation and Storage Segment\\nEnergy Generation and Storage Sales\\nEnergy generation and storage sales revenue consists of the sale of solar energy systems and energy storage systems to residential, small\\ncommercial, large commercial and utility grade customers. Sales of solar energy systems to residential and small scale commercial customers consist of\\nthe engineering, design and installation of the system. Residential and small scale commercial customers pay the full purchase price of the solar energy\\nsystem upfront. Revenue for the design and installation obligation is recognized when control transfers, which is when we install a solar energy system\\nand the system passes inspection by the utility or the authority having jurisdiction. Sales of energy storage systems to residential and small scale\\ncommercial customers consist of the installation of the energy storage system and revenue is recognized when control transfers, which is when the\\nproduct has been delivered or, if we are performing installation, when installed and commissioned. Payment for such storage systems is made upon\\ninvoice or in accordance with payment terms customary to the business.\\nFor large commercial and utility grade energy storage system sales which consist of the engineering, design and installation of the system,\\ncustomers make milestone payments that are consistent with contract-specific phases of a project. Revenue from such contracts is recognized over time\\nusing the percentage of completion method based on cost incurred as a percentage of total estimated contract costs for energy storage system sales.\\nIn instances where there are multiple performance obligations in a single contract, we allocate the consideration to the various obligations in the\\ncontract based on the relative standalone selling price method. Standalone selling prices are estimated based on estimated costs plus margin or by using\\nmarket data for comparable products. Costs to obtain a contract relate mainly to commissions paid to our sales personnel related to the sale of energy\\nstorage systems. As our contract costs related to energy storage system sales are typically fulfilled within one year, the costs to obtain a contract are\\nexpensed as incurred.\\nAs part of our energy storage system contracts, we may provide the customer with performance guarantees that warrant that the underlying system\\nwill meet or exceed the minimum energy performance requirements specified in the contract. If an energy storage system does not meet the\\nperformance guarantee requirements, we may be required to pay liquidated damages. Other forms of variable consideration related to our large\\ncommercial and utility grade energy storage system contracts include variable customer payments that will be made based on our energy market\\nparticipation activities. Such guarantees and variable customer payments represent a form of variable consideration and are estimated at contract\\ninception at their most likely amount and updated at the end of each reporting period as additional performance data becomes available. Such estimates\\nare included in the transaction price only to the extent that it is probable a significant reversal of revenue will not occur.\\nWe record as deferred revenue any non-refundable amounts that are collected from customers related to fees charged for prepayments, which is\\nrecognized as revenue ratably over the respective customer contract term. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, deferred revenue related to such\\ncustomer payments amounted to $1.60 billion and $863 million, respectively, mainly due to contractual payment terms. Revenue recognized from the\\ndeferred revenue balance as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 was $571 million and $171 million for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022,\\nrespectively. We have elected the practical expedient to omit disclosure of the amount of the transaction price allocated to remaining performance\\nobligations for energy generation and storage sales with an original expected contract length of one year or less and the amount that we have the right to\\ninvoice when that amount corresponds directly with the value of the performance to date. As of December 31, 2023, total transaction price allocated to\\nperformance obligations that were unsatisfied or partially unsatisfied for contracts with an original expected length of more than one year was $3.43\\nbillion. Of this amount, we expect to recognize $1.05 billion in the next 12 months and the rest over the remaining performance obligation period.\\nWe have been providing loans for financing our energy generation products in volume since fiscal year 2022. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022,\\nwe have recorded net financing receivables on the consolidated balance sheets, of which $31 million and $24 million, respectively, is recorded within\\nAccounts receivable, net, for the current portion and $578 million and $387 million, respectively, is recorded within Other non-current assets for the long-\\nterm portion.\\n58\\nEnergy Generation and Storage Leasing\\nFor revenue arrangements where we are the lessor under operating lease agreements for energy generation and storage products, we record lease\\nrevenue from minimum lease payments, including upfront rebates and incentives earned from such systems, on a straight-line basis over the life of the\\nlease term, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria have been met. The difference between the payments received and the revenue recognized is\\nrecorded as deferred revenue or deferred asset on the consolidated balance sheet.\\nFor solar energy systems where customers purchase electricity from us under PPAs prior to January 1, 2019, we have determined that these\\nagreements should be accounted for as operating leases pursuant to ASC 840, Leases. Revenue is recognized based on the amount of electricity\\ndelivered at rates specified under the contracts, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met.\\nWe record as deferred revenue any amounts that are collected from customers, including lease prepayments, in excess of revenue recognized,\\nwhich is recognized as revenue ratably over the respective customer contract term. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, deferred revenue related to such\\ncustomer payments amounted to $181 million and $191 million, respectively. Deferred revenue also includes the portion of rebates and incentives\\nreceived from utility companies and various local and state government agencies, which is recognized as revenue over the lease term. As of\\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022, deferred revenue from rebates and incentives was immaterial.\\nWe capitalize initial direct costs from the execution of agreements for solar energy systems and PPAs, which include the referral fees and sales\\ncommissions, as an element of solar energy systems, net, and subsequently amortize these costs over the term of the related agreements.\\nCost of Revenues\\nAutomotive Segment\\nAutomotive Sales\\nCost of automotive sales revenue includes direct and indirect materials, labor costs, manufacturing overhead, including depreciation costs of tooling\\nand machinery, shipping and logistic costs, vehicle connectivity costs, FSD Capability ongoing maintenance costs, allocations of electricity and\\ninfrastructure costs related to our Supercharger network and reserves for estimated warranty expenses. Cost of automotive sales revenues also includes\\nadjustments to warranty expense and charges to write down the carrying value of our inventory when it exceeds its estimated net realizable value and to\\nprovide for obsolete and on-hand inventory in excess of forecasted demand. Additionally, cost of automotive sales revenue benefits from manufacturing\\ncredits earned.\\nAutomotive Leasing\\nCost of automotive leasing revenue includes the depreciation of operating lease vehicles, cost of goods sold associated with direct sales-type leases\\nand warranty expense related to leased vehicles.\\nServices and Other\\nCosts of services and other revenue includes cost of used vehicles including refurbishment costs, costs associated with providing non-warranty\\nafter-sales services, costs associated with our body shops and part sales, costs of paid Supercharging, costs to provide vehicle insurance and costs for\\nretail merchandise.\\nEnergy Generation and Storage Segment\\nEnergy Generation and Storage\\nCost of energy generation and storage revenue includes direct and indirect material and labor costs, overhead costs, freight, warranty expense, and\\namortization of certain acquired intangible assets. Cost of energy generation and storage revenue also includes charges to write down the carrying value\\nof our inventory when it exceeds its estimated net realizable value and to provide for obsolete and on-hand inventory in excess of forecasted demand.\\nAdditionally, cost of energy generation and storage revenue benefits from manufacturing credits earned. In agreements for solar energy systems and\\nPPAs where we are the lessor, the cost of revenue is primarily comprised of depreciation of the cost of leased solar energy systems, maintenance costs\\nassociated with those systems and amortization of any initial direct costs.\\n59\\nResearch and Development Costs\\nResearch and development costs are expensed as incurred.\\nIncome Taxes\\nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and in many foreign jurisdictions. Income taxes are computed using the asset and liability method, under\\nwhich deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities\\nusing enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income. Valuation allowances are established when\\nnecessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized.\\nWe monitor the realizability of our deferred tax assets taking into account all relevant factors at each reporting period. Significant judgment is\\nrequired in determining our provision for income taxes, our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net\\ndeferred tax assets that are not more likely than not to be realized. In completing our assessment of realizability of our deferred tax assets, we consider\\nour history of income (loss) measured at pre-tax income (loss) adjusted for permanent book-tax differences on a jurisdictional basis, volatility in actual\\nearnings, excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation in recent prior years, and impacts of the timing of reversal of existing temporary\\ndifferences. We also rely on our assessment of the Company’s projected future results of business operations, including uncertainty in future operating\\nresults relative to historical results, volatility in the market price of our common stock and its performance over time, variable macroeconomic conditions\\nimpacting our ability to forecast future taxable income, and changes in business that may affect the existence and magnitude of future taxable income.\\nOur valuation allowance assessment is based on our best estimate of future results considering all available information.\\nWe record liabilities related to uncertain tax positions when, despite our belief that our tax return positions are supportable, we believe that it is\\nmore likely than not that those positions may not be fully sustained upon review by tax authorities. Accrued interest and penalties related to\\nunrecognized tax benefits are classified as income tax expense.\\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act subjects a U.S. shareholder to tax on global intangible low-taxed income (“GILTI”) earned by certain foreign subsidiaries.\\nUnder GAAP, we can make an accounting policy election to either treat taxes due on the GILTI inclusion as a current period expense or factor such\\namounts into our measurement of deferred taxes. We elected the deferred method, under which we recorded the corresponding deferred tax assets and\\nliabilities in our consolidated balance sheets.\\nComprehensive Income\\nComprehensive income is comprised of net income and other comprehensive income (loss). Other comprehensive income (loss) consists of foreign\\ncurrency translation adjustments and unrealized net gains and losses on investments that have been excluded from the determination of net income.\\nStock-Based Compensation\\nWe use the fair value method of accounting for our stock options and RSUs granted to employees and for our ESPP to measure the cost of employee\\nservices received in exchange for the stock-based awards. The fair value of stock option awards with only service and/or performance conditions is\\nestimated on the grant or offering date using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The Black-Scholes option-pricing model requires inputs such as the\\nrisk-free interest rate, expected term and expected volatility. These inputs are subjective and generally require significant judgment. The fair value of\\nRSUs is measured on the grant date based on the closing fair market value of our common stock. The resulting cost is recognized over the period during\\nwhich an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the awards, usually the vesting period, which is generally four years for stock options\\nand RSUs and six months for the ESPP. Stock-based compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis, net of actual forfeitures in the period.\\nFor performance-based awards, stock-based compensation expense is recognized over the expected performance achievement period of individual\\nperformance milestones when the achievement of each individual performance milestone becomes probable.\\n60\\nAs we accumulate additional employee stock-based awards data over time and as we incorporate market data related to our common stock, we may\\ncalculate significantly different volatilities and expected lives, which could materially impact the valuation of our stock-based awards and the stock-based\\ncompensation expense that we will recognize in future periods. Stock-based compensation expense is recorded in Cost of revenues, Research and\\ndevelopment expense and Selling, general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of operations.\\nNoncontrolling Interests and Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests\\nNoncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests represent third-party interests in the net assets under certain funding\\narrangements, or funds, that we have entered into to finance the costs of solar energy systems and vehicles under operating leases. We have determined\\nthat the contractual provisions of the funds represent substantive profit-sharing arrangements. We have further determined that the methodology for\\ncalculating the noncontrolling interest and redeemable noncontrolling interest balances that reflects the substantive profit-sharing arrangements is a\\nbalance sheet approach using the hypothetical liquidation at book value (“HLBV”) method. We, therefore, determine the amount of the noncontrolling\\ninterests and redeemable noncontrolling interests in the net assets of the funds at each balance sheet date using the HLBV method, which is presented on\\nthe consolidated balance sheet as noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries and redeemable noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries. Under the HLBV\\nmethod, the amounts reported as noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests in the consolidated balance sheet represent the\\namounts the third parties would hypothetically receive at each balance sheet date under the liquidation provisions of the funds, assuming the net assets\\nof the funds were liquidated at their recorded amounts determined in accordance with GAAP and with tax laws effective at the balance sheet date and\\ndistributed to the third parties. The third parties’ interests in the results of operations of the funds are determined as the difference in the noncontrolling\\ninterest and redeemable noncontrolling interest balances in the consolidated balance sheets between the start and end of each reporting period, after\\ntaking into account any capital transactions between the funds and the third parties. However, the redeemable noncontrolling interest balance is at least\\nequal to the redemption amount. The redeemable noncontrolling interest balance is presented as temporary equity in the mezzanine section of the\\nconsolidated balance sheet since these third parties have the right to redeem their interests in the funds for cash or other assets. For certain funds, there\\nhave been significant fluctuations in net (loss) income attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries due\\nto changes in the liquidation provisions as time-based milestones have been reached.\\nNet Income per Share of Common Stock Attributable to Common Stockholders\\nBasic net income per share of common stock attributable to common stockholders is calculated by dividing net income attributable to common\\nstockholders by the weighted-average shares of common stock outstanding for the period. Potentially dilutive shares, which are based on the weighted-\\naverage shares of common stock underlying outstanding stock-based awards, warrants and convertible senior notes using the treasury stock method or\\nthe if-converted method, as applicable, are included when calculating diluted net income per share of common stock attributable to common stockholders\\nwhen their effect is dilutive.\\nFurthermore, in connection with the offerings of our convertible senior notes, we entered into convertible note hedges and warrants (see Note 11,\\nDebt). However, our convertible note hedges are not included when calculating potentially dilutive shares since their effect is always anti-dilutive. The\\nstrike price on the warrants were below our average share price during the period and were included in the tables below. Warrants are included in the\\nweighted-average shares used in computing basic net income per share of common stock in the period(s) they are settled.\\nThe following table presents the reconciliation of net income attributable to common stockholders to net income used in computing basic and\\ndiluted net income per share of common stock (in millions):\\nYear Ended December 31,\\n2023\\n2022\\n2021\\nNet income attributable to common stockholders\\n$\\n14,997 \\n$\\n12,556 \\n$\\n5,519 \\nLess: Buy-out of noncontrolling interest\\n(2)\\n(27)\\n(5)\\nNet income used in computing basic net income per share of common stock\\n14,999 \\n12,583 \\n5,524 \\nLess: Dilutive convertible debt\\n— \\n(1)\\n(9)\\nNet income used in computing diluted net income per share of common stock\\n$\\n14,999 \\n$\\n12,584 \\n$\\n5,533 \\n61\\nThe following table presents the reconciliation of basic to diluted weighted average shares used in computing net income per share of common\\nstock attributable to common stockholders (in millions):\\nYear Ended December 31,\\n2023\\n2022\\n2021\\nWeighted average shares used in computing net income per share of common stock,\\nbasic\\n3,174\\n3,130\\n2,959\\nAdd:\\nStock-based awards\\n298\\n310\\n292\\nConvertible senior notes\\n2\\n3\\n29\\nWarrants\\n11\\n32\\n106\\nWeighted average shares used in computing net income per share of common stock,\\ndiluted\\n3,485\\n3,475\\n3,386\\nThe following table presents the potentially dilutive shares that were excluded from the computation of diluted net income per share of common\\nstock attributable to common stockholders, because their effect was anti-dilutive (in millions):\\nYear Ended December 31,\\n2023\\n2022\\n2021\\nStock-based awards\\n12\\n4\\n1\\nBusiness Combinations\\nWe account for business acquisitions under ASC 805, Business Combinations. The total purchase consideration for an acquisition is measured as the\\nfair value of the assets given, equity instruments issued and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date. Costs that are directly attributable to the\\nacquisition are expensed as incurred. Identifiable assets (including intangible assets), liabilities assumed (including contingent liabilities) and\\nnoncontrolling interests in an acquisition are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date. We recognize goodwill if the fair value of the\\ntotal purchase consideration and any noncontrolling interests is in excess of the net fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities\\nassumed. We recognize a bargain purchase gain within Other income (expense), net, in the consolidated statement of operations if the net fair value of\\nthe identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed is in excess of the fair value of the total purchase consideration and any noncontrolling\\ninterests. We include the results of operations of the acquired business in the consolidated financial statements beginning on the acquisition date.\\nCash and Cash Equivalents\\nAll highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase are considered cash equivalents. Our cash\\nequivalents are primarily comprised of U.S. government securities, money market funds and commercial paper.\\nRestricted Cash\\nWe maintain certain cash balances restricted as to withdrawal or use. Our restricted cash is comprised primarily of cash held to service certain\\npayments under various secured debt facilities. In addition, restricted cash includes cash held as collateral for sales to lease partners with a resale value\\nguarantee, letters of credit, real estate leases and deposits held for our insurance services. We record restricted cash as other assets in the consolidated\\nbalance sheets and determine current or non-current classification based on the expected duration of the restriction.\\n62\\nOur total cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash, as presented in the consolidated statements of cash flows, was as follows (in millions):\\nDecember 31,\\n2023\\nDecember 31,\\n2022\\nDecember 31,\\n2021\\nCash and cash equivalents\\n$\\n16,398 \\n$\\n16,253 \\n$\\n17,576 \\nRestricted cash included in prepaid expenses and other current assets\\n543 \\n294 \\n345 \\nRestricted cash included in other non-current assets\\n248 \\n377 \\n223 \\nTotal as presented in the consolidated statements of cash flows\\n$\\n17,189 \\n$\\n16,924 \\n$\\n18,144 \\nInvestments\\nInvestments may be comprised of a combination of marketable securities, including U.S. government securities, corporate debt securities,\\ncommercial paper, time deposits, and certain certificates of deposit, which are all designated as available-for-sale and reported at estimated fair value,\\nwith unrealized gains and losses recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income which is included within stockholders’ equity. Available-for-sale\\nmarketable securities with maturities greater than three months at the date of purchase are included in short-term investments in our consolidated\\nbalance sheets. Interest, dividends, amortization and accretion of purchase premiums and discounts on these investments are included within Interest\\nincome in our consolidated statements of operations.\\nThe cost of available-for-sale investments sold is based on the specific identification method. Realized gains and losses on the sale of available-for-\\nsale investments are recorded in Other income (expense), net.\\nWe regularly review all of our investments for declines in fair value. The review includes but is not limited to (i) the consideration of the cause of the\\ndecline, (ii) any currently recorded expected credit losses and (iii) the creditworthiness of the respective security issuers. The amortized cost basis of our\\ninvestments approximates its fair value.\\nAccounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts\\nAccounts receivable primarily include amounts related to receivables from financial institutions and leasing companies offering various financing\\nproducts to our customers, sales of energy generation and storage products, sales of regulatory credits to other automotive manufacturers and\\ngovernment rebates already passed through to customers. We provide an allowance against accounts receivable for the amount we expect to be\\nuncollectible. We write-off accounts receivable against the allowance when they are deemed uncollectible.\\nDepending on the day of the week on which the end of a fiscal quarter falls, our accounts receivable balance may fluctuate as we are waiting for\\ncertain customer payments to clear through our banking institutions and receipts of payments from our financing partners, which can take up to\\napproximately two weeks based on the contractual payment terms with such partners. Our accounts receivable balances associated with our sales of\\nregulatory credits are dependent on contractual payment terms. Additionally, government rebates can take up to a year or more to be collected\\ndepending on the customary processing timelines of the specific jurisdictions issuing them. These various factors may have a significant impact on our\\naccounts receivable balance from period to period. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, we had $207 million and $753 million, respectively, of long-term\\ngovernment rebates receivable in Other non-current assets in our consolidated balance sheets.\\nFinancing Receivables\\nWe provide financing options to our customers for our automotive and energy products. Financing receivables are carried at amortized cost, net of\\nallowance for loan losses. Provisions for loan losses are charged to operations in amounts sufficient to maintain the allowance for loan losses at levels\\nconsidered adequate to cover expected credit losses on the financing receivables. In determining expected credit losses, we consider our historical level\\nof credit losses, current economic trends, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the future cash flows.\\nWhen originating consumer receivables, we review the credit application, the proposed contract terms, credit bureau information (e.g., FICO score)\\nand other information. Our evaluation emphasizes the applicant’s ability to pay and creditworthiness focusing on payment, affordability, and applicant\\ncredit history as key considerations. Generally, all customers in this portfolio have strong creditworthiness at loan origination.\\n63\\nAfter origination, we review the credit quality of retail financing based on customer payment activity and aging analysis. For all financing\\nreceivables, we define “past due” as any payment, including principal and interest, which is at least 31 days past the contractual due date. As of\\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022, the vast majority of our financing receivables were at current status with only an immaterial balance being past due. As of\\nDecember 31, 2023, the majority of our financing receivables, excluding MyPower notes receivable, were originated in 2023 and 2022, and as of\\nDecember 31, 2022, the majority of our financing receivables, excluding MyPower notes receivable, were originated in 2022.\\nWe have customer notes receivable under the legacy MyPower loan program, which provided residential customers with the option to finance the\\npurchase of a solar energy system through a 30-year loan and were all originated prior to year 2018. The outstanding balances, net of any allowance for\\nexpected credit losses, are presented on the consolidated balance sheets as a component of Prepaid expenses and other current assets for the current\\nportion and as Other non-current assets for the long-term portion. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the total outstanding balance of MyPower\\ncustomer notes receivable, net of allowance for expected credit losses, was $266 million and $280 million, respectively, of which $5 million and $7 million\\nwere due in the next 12 months as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the allowance for expected credit\\nlosses was $36 million and $37 million, respectively.\\nConcentration of Risk\\nCredit Risk\\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject us to a concentration of credit risk consist of cash, cash equivalents, investments, restricted cash,\\naccounts receivable and other finance receivables. Our cash and investments balances are primarily on deposit at high credit quality financial institutions\\nor invested in money market funds. These deposits are typically in excess of insured limits. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, no entity represented\\n10% or more of our total receivables balance.\\nSupply Risk\\nWe are dependent on our suppliers, including single source suppliers, and the inability of these suppliers to deliver necessary components of our\\nproducts in a timely manner at prices, quality levels and volumes acceptable to us, or our inability to efficiently manage these components from these\\nsuppliers, could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.\\nInventory Valuation\\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is computed using standard cost for vehicles and energy products, which\\napproximates actual cost on a first-in, first-out basis. We record inventory write-downs for excess or obsolete inventories based upon assumptions about\\ncurrent and future demand forecasts. If our inventory on-hand is in excess of our future demand forecast, the excess amounts are written-off.\\nWe also review our inventory to determine whether its carrying value exceeds the net amount realizable upon the ultimate sale of the inventory.\\nThis requires us to determine the estimated selling price of our vehicles less the estimated cost to convert the inventory on-hand into a finished product.\\nOnce inventory is written-down, a new, lower cost basis for that inventory is established and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result\\nin the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis.\\nShould our estimates of future selling prices or production costs change, additional and potentially material write-downs may be required. A small\\nchange in our estimates may result in a material charge to our reported financial results.\\nOperating Lease Vehicles\\nVehicles that are leased as part of our direct vehicle leasing program are classified as operating lease vehicles at cost less accumulated\\ndepreciation. We generally depreciate their cost, less residual value, using the straight-line-method to cost of automotive leasing revenue over the\\ncontractual period. The gross cost of operating lease vehicles as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 was $7.36 billion and $6.08 billion, respectively.\\nOperating lease vehicles on the consolidated balance sheets are presented net of accumulated depreciation of $1.38 billion and $1.04 billion as of\\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\\n64\\nDigital Assets, Net\\nWe currently account for all digital assets held as indefinite-lived intangible assets in accordance with ASC 350, Intangibles—Goodwill and Other. We\\nhave ownership of and control over our digital assets and we may use third-party custodial services to secure it. The digital assets are initially recorded at\\ncost and are subsequently remeasured on the consolidated balance sheet at cost, net of any impairment losses incurred since acquisition.\\nWe determine the fair value of our digital assets on a nonrecurring basis in accordance with ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement (“ASC 820”), based\\non quoted prices on the active exchange(s) that we have determined is the principal market for such assets (Level I inputs). We perform an analysis each\\nquarter to identify whether events or changes in circumstances, principally decreases in the quoted prices on active exchanges, indicate that it is more\\nlikely than not that our digital assets are impaired. In determining if an impairment has occurred, we consider the lowest market price of one unit of\\ndigital asset quoted on the active exchange since acquiring the digital asset. When the then current carrying value of a digital asset exceeds the fair\\nvalue determined each quarter, an impairment loss has occurred with respect to those digital assets in the amount equal to the difference between their\\ncarrying values and the prices determined.\\nImpairment losses are recognized within Restructuring and other in the consolidated statements of operations in the period in which the impairment\\nis identified. Gains are not recorded until realized upon sale(s), at which point they are presented net of any impairment losses for the same digital assets\\nheld within Restructuring and other. In determining the gain to be recognized upon sale, we calculate the difference between the sales price and carrying\\nvalue of the digital assets sold immediately prior to sale.\\nSee Note 3, Digital Assets, Net, for further information regarding digital assets.\\nSolar Energy Systems, Net\\nWe are the lessor of solar energy systems. Solar energy systems are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation.\\nDepreciation and amortization is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets, as follows:\\nSolar energy systems in service\\n30 to 35 years\\nInitial direct costs related to customer solar energy system lease acquisition costs\\nLease term (up to 25 years)\\nSolar energy systems pending interconnection will be depreciated as solar energy systems in service when they have been interconnected and\\nplaced in-service. Solar energy systems under construction represents systems that are under installation, which will be depreciated as solar energy\\nsystems in service when they are completed, interconnected and placed in service. Initial direct costs related to customer solar energy system agreement\\nacquisition costs are capitalized and amortized over the term of the related customer agreements.\\nProperty, Plant and Equipment, Net\\nProperty, plant and equipment, net, including leasehold improvements, are recognized at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is\\ngenerally computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets, as follows:\\nMachinery, equipment, vehicles and office furniture\\n3 to 15 years\\nTooling\\n4 to 7 years\\nBuilding and building improvements\\n15 to 30 years\\nComputer equipment and software\\n3 to 10 years\\nLeasehold improvements are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or the terms of the related leases.\\nUpon the retirement or sale of our property, plant and equipment, the cost and associated accumulated depreciation are removed from the\\nconsolidated balance sheet, and the resulting gain or loss is reflected on the consolidated statement of operations. Maintenance and repair expenditures\\nare expensed as incurred while major improvements that increase the functionality, output or expected life of an asset are capitalized and depreciated\\nratably over the identified useful life.\\n65\\nInterest expense on outstanding debt is capitalized during the period of significant capital asset construction. Capitalized interest on construction in\\nprogress is included within Property, plant and equipment, net and is amortized over the life of the related assets.\\nLong-Lived Assets Including Acquired Intangible Assets\\nWe review our property, plant and equipment, solar energy systems, long-term prepayments and intangible assets for impairment whenever events\\nor changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset (or asset group) may not be recoverable. We measure recoverability by\\ncomparing the carrying amount to the future undiscounted cash flows that the asset is expected to generate. If the asset is not recoverable, its carrying\\namount would be adjusted down to its fair value. For the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, we have recognized no material impairments\\nof our long-lived assets.\\nIntangible assets with definite lives are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, which range from seven to thirty years.\\nGoodwill\\nWe assess goodwill for impairment annually in the fourth quarter, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that it might be\\nimpaired, by comparing its carrying value to the reporting unit’s fair value. For the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, we did not\\nrecognize any impairment of goodwill.\\nCapitalization of Software Costs\\nWe capitalize costs incurred in the development of internal use software, during the application development stage to Property, plant and\\nequipment, net on the consolidated balance sheets. Costs related to preliminary project activities and post-implementation activities are expensed as\\nincurred. Such costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful life of three to five years.\\nSoftware development costs incurred in development of software to be sold, leased, or otherwise marketed, incurred subsequent to the\\nestablishment of technological feasibility and prior to the general availability of the software are capitalized when they are expected to become\\nsignificant. Such costs are amortized over the estimated useful life of the applicable software once it is made generally available to our customers.\\nWe evaluate the useful lives of these assets on an annual basis, and we test for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances occur\\nthat could impact the recoverability of these assets. For the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, we have recognized no impairments of\\ncapitalized software costs.\\nForeign Currency\\nWe determine the functional and reporting currency of each of our international subsidiaries and their operating divisions based on the primary\\ncurrency in which they operate. In cases where the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar, we recognize a cumulative translation adjustment created by\\nthe different rates we apply to current period income or loss and the balance sheet. For each subsidiary, we apply the monthly average functional\\nexchange rate to its monthly income or loss and the month-end functional currency rate to translate the balance sheet.\\nForeign currency transaction gains and losses are a result of the effect of exchange rate changes on transactions denominated in currencies other\\nthan the functional currency of the respective subsidiary. Transaction gains and losses are recognized in Other income (expense), net, in the consolidated\\nstatements of operations. For the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, we recorded a net foreign currency transaction gain of $122 million,\\nloss of $89 million and gain of $97 million, respectively.\\n66\\nWarranties\\nWe provide a manufacturer’s warranty on all new and used vehicles and a warranty on the installation and components of the energy generation\\nand storage systems we sell for periods typically between 10 to 25 years. We accrue a warranty reserve for the products sold by us, which includes our\\nbest estimate of the projected costs to repair or replace items under warranties and recalls if identified. These estimates are based on actual claims\\nincurred to date and an estimate of the nature, frequency and costs of future claims. These estimates are inherently uncertain and changes to our\\nhistorical or projected warranty experience may cause material changes to the warranty reserve in the future. The warranty reserve does not include\\nprojected warranty costs associated with our vehicles subject to operating lease accounting and our solar energy systems under lease contracts or PPAs,\\nas the costs to repair these warranty claims are expensed as incurred. The portion of the warranty reserve expected to be incurred within the next 12\\nmonths is included within Accrued liabilities and other, while the remaining balance is included within Other long-term liabilities on the consolidated\\nbalance sheets. For liabilities that we are entitled to receive indemnification from our suppliers, we record receivables for the contractually obligated\\namounts on the consolidated balance sheets as a component of Prepaid expenses and other current assets for the current portion and as Other non-\\ncurrent assets for the long-term portion. Warranty expense is recorded as a component of Cost of revenues in the consolidated statements of operations.\\nDue to the magnitude of our automotive business, our accrued warranty balance is primarily related to our automotive segment. Accrued warranty\\nactivity consisted of the following (in millions):\\nYear Ended December 31,\\n2023\\n2022\\n2021\\nAccrued warranty—beginning of period\\n$\\n3,505 \\n$\\n2,101 \\n$\\n1,468 \\nWarranty costs incurred\\n(1,225)\\n(803)\\n(525)\\nNet changes in liability for pre-existing warranties, including expirations and foreign\\nexchange impact\\n539 \\n522 \\n102 \\nProvision for warranty\\n2,333 \\n1,685 \\n1,056 \\nAccrued warranty—end of period\\n$\\n5,152 \\n$\\n3,505 \\n$\\n2,101 \\nCustomer Deposits\\nCustomer deposits primarily consist of refundable cash payments from customers at the time they place an order or reservation for a vehicle or an\\nenergy product and any additional payments up to the point of delivery or the completion of installation. Customer deposits also include prepayments on\\ncontracts that can be cancelled without significant penalties, such as vehicle maintenance plans. Customer deposits are included in Accrued liabilities and\\nother on the consolidated balance sheets until refunded, forfeited or applied towards the customer’s purchase balance.\\nGovernment Assistance Programs and Incentives\\nGlobally, the operation of our business is impacted by various government programs, incentives, and other arrangements. Government incentives\\nare recorded in our consolidated financial statements in accordance with their purpose as a reduction of expense, or an offset to the related capital asset.\\nThe benefit is generally recorded when all conditions attached to the incentive have been met or are expected to be met and there is reasonable\\nassurance of their receipt.\\nThe IRA Incentives\\nOn August 16, 2022, the IRA was enacted into law and is effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2022. The IRA includes multiple\\nincentives to promote clean energy, electric vehicles, battery and energy storage manufacture or purchase, in addition to a new corporate alternative\\nminimum tax of 15% on adjusted financial statement income of corporations with profits greater than $1 billion. Some of these measures are expected to\\nmaterially affect our consolidated financial statements. For the year ended December 31, 2023, the impact from our IRA incentive was primarily a\\nreduction of our material costs in our consolidated statement of operations. We will continue to evaluate the effects of the IRA as more guidance is issued\\nand the relevant implications to our consolidated financial statements.\\n67\\nGigafactory New York—New York State Investment and Lease\\nWe have a lease through the Research Foundation for the SUNY Foundation with respect to Gigafactory New York. Under the lease and a related\\nresearch and development agreement, we are continuing to designate further buildouts at the facility. We are required to comply with certain covenants,\\nincluding hiring and cumulative investment targets. Under the terms of the arrangement, the SUNY Foundation paid for a majority of the construction\\ncosts related to the manufacturing facility and the acquisition and commissioning of certain manufacturing equipment; and we are responsible for any\\nconstruction or equipment costs in excess of such amount (refer to Note 15, Commitments and Contingencies). This incentive reduces the related lease\\ncosts of the facility within the Energy generation and storage cost of revenues and operating expense line items in our consolidated statements of\\noperations.\\nGigafactory Shanghai—Land Use Rights and Economic Benefits\\nWe have an agreement with the local government of Shanghai for land use rights at Gigafactory Shanghai. Under the terms of the arrangement, we\\nare required to meet a cumulative capital expenditure target and an annual tax revenue target starting at the end of 2023. In addition, the Shanghai\\ngovernment has granted to our Gigafactory Shanghai subsidiary certain incentives to be used in connection with eligible capital investments at\\nGigafactory Shanghai (refer to Note 15, Commitments and Contingencies). For the year ended December 31, 2022, we received grant funding of $76\\nmillion. These incentives offset the related costs of our facilities and are recorded as a reduction of the cost of the capital investment within the Property,\\nplant and equipment, net line item in our consolidated balance sheets. The incentive therefore reduces the depreciation expense over the useful lives of\\nthe related equipment.\\nNevada Tax Incentives\\nIn connection with the construction of Gigafactory Nevada, we entered into agreements with the State of Nevada and Storey County in Nevada that\\nprovide abatements for specified taxes, discounts to the base tariff energy rates and transferable tax credits of up to $195 million in consideration of\\ncapital investment and hiring targets that were met at Gigafactory Nevada.\\nGigafactory Texas Tax Incentives\\nIn connection with the construction of Gigafactory Texas, we entered into a 20-year agreement with Travis County in Texas pursuant to which we\\nwould receive grant funding equal to 70-80% of property taxes paid by us to Travis County and a separate 10-year agreement with the Del Valle\\nIndependent School District in Texas pursuant to which a portion of the taxable value of our property would be capped at a specified amount, in each case\\nsubject to our meeting certain minimum economic development metrics through our construction and operations at Gigafactory Texas. This incentive is\\nrecorded as a reduction of the related expenses within the Cost of automotive revenues and operating expense line items of our consolidated statements\\nof operations. As of December 31, 2023, the grant funding related to property taxes paid were immaterial.\\nDefined Contribution Plan\\nWe have a 401(k) savings plan in the U.S. that is intended to qualify as a deferred salary arrangement under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue\\nCode and a number of savings plans internationally. Under the 401(k) savings plan, participating employees may elect to contribute up to 90% of their\\neligible compensation, subject to certain limitations. Beginning in January 2022, we began to match 50% of each employee’s contributions up to a\\nmaximum of 6% (capped at $3,000) of the employee’s eligible compensation, vested upon one year of service. During the years ended December 31,\\n2023 and 2022, we recognized $99 million and $91 million, respectively, of expenses related to employer contributions for the 401(k) savings plan.\\n68\\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\\nRecently issued accounting pronouncements not yet adopted\\nIn November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued ASU No. 2023-07, Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures\\n(Topic 280). This ASU updates reportable segment disclosure requirements by requiring disclosures of significant reportable segment expenses that are\\nregularly provided to the Chief Operating Decision Maker (“CODM”) and included within each reported measure of a segment's profit or loss. This ASU also\\nrequires disclosure of the title and position of the individual identified as the CODM and an explanation of how the CODM uses the reported measures of a\\nsegment’s profit or loss in assessing segment performance and deciding how to allocate resources. The ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after\\nDecember 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. Adoption of the ASU should be applied retrospectively to\\nall prior periods presented in the financial statements. Early adoption is also permitted. This ASU will likely result in us including the additional required\\ndisclosures when adopted. We are currently evaluating the provisions of this ASU and expect to adopt them for the year ending December 31, 2024.\\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-08, Accounting for and Disclosure of Crypto Assets (Subtopic 350-60). This ASU requires certain\\ncrypto assets to be measured at fair value separately in the balance sheet and income statement each reporting period. This ASU also enhances the other\\nintangible asset disclosure requirements by requiring the name, cost basis, fair value, and number of units for each significant crypto holding. The ASU is\\neffective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Adoption of the ASU requires a\\ncumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings as of the beginning of the annual reporting period in which an entity adopts the\\namendments. Early adoption is also permitted, including adoption in an interim period. However, if the ASU is early adopted in an interim period, an entity\\nmust adopt the ASU as of the beginning of the fiscal year that includes the interim period. This ASU will result in gains and losses recorded in the\\nconsolidated financial statements of operations and additional disclosures when adopted. We are currently evaluating the adoption of this ASU and it will\\naffect the carrying value of our crypto assets held and the gains and losses relating thereto, once adopted.\\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures (Topic 740). The ASU requires disaggregated\\ninformation about a reporting entity’s effective tax rate reconciliation as well as additional information on income taxes paid. The ASU is effective on a\\nprospective basis for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is also permitted for annual financial statements that have not\\nyet been issued or made available for issuance. This ASU will result in the required additional disclosures being included in our consolidated financial\\nstatements, once adopted.\\nRecently adopted accounting pronouncements\\nIn October 2021, the FASB issued ASU No. 2021-08, Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers (Topic\\n805). This ASU requires an acquirer in a business combination to recognize and measure contract assets and contract liabilities (deferred revenue) from\\nacquired contracts using the revenue recognition guidance in Topic 606. At the acquisition date, the acquirer applies the revenue model as if it had\\noriginated the acquired contracts. The ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2022, including interim periods within those fiscal\\nyears. We adopted this ASU prospectively on January 1, 2023. This ASU has not and is currently not expected to have a material impact on our\\nconsolidated financial statements.\\nIn March 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-02, Troubled Debt Restructurings and Vintage Disclosures. This ASU eliminates the accounting guidance\\nfor troubled debt restructurings by creditors that have adopted ASU 2016-13, Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, which we adopted\\non January 1, 2020. This ASU also enhances the disclosure requirements for certain loan refinancing and restructurings by creditors when a borrower is\\nexperiencing financial difficulty. In addition, the ASU amends the guidance on vintage disclosures to require entities to disclose current period gross write-\\noffs by year of origination for financing receivables and net investments in leases within the scope of ASC 326-20. The ASU is effective for annual periods\\nbeginning after December 15, 2022, including interim periods within those fiscal years. We adopted the ASU prospectively on January 1, 2023. This ASU\\nhas not and is currently not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\\n69\\nASU 2020-06\\nIn August 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-06, Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity’s Own Equity. The ASU simplifies\\nthe accounting for convertible instruments by removing certain separation models in ASC 470-20, Debt—Debt with Conversion and Other Options, for\\nconvertible instruments. The ASU updates the guidance on certain embedded conversion features that are not required to be accounted for as derivatives\\nunder Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, or that do not result in substantial premiums accounted for as paid-in capital, such that those features are no\\nlonger required to be separated from the host contract. The convertible debt instruments will be accounted for as a single liability measured at amortized\\ncost. This will also result in the interest expense recognized for convertible debt instruments to be typically closer to the coupon interest rate when\\napplying the guidance in Topic 835, Interest. Further, the ASU made amendments to the EPS guidance in Topic 260 for convertible debt instruments, the\\nmost significant impact of which is requiring the use of the if-converted method for diluted EPS calculation, and no longer allowing the net share\\nsettlement method. The ASU also made revisions to Topic 815-40, which provides guidance on how an entity must determine whether a contract qualifies\\nfor a scope exception from derivative accounting. The amendments to Topic 815-40 change the scope of contracts that are recognized as assets or\\nliabilities.\\nOn January 1, 2021, we adopted the ASU using the modified retrospective method. We recognized a favorable $211 million cumulative effect of\\ninitially applying the ASU as an adjustment to the January 1, 2021 opening balance of accumulated deficit. Due to the recombination of the equity\\nconversion component of our convertible debt remaining outstanding, additional paid in capital was reduced by $474 million and convertible senior notes\\n(mezzanine equity) was reduced by $51 million. The removal of the remaining debt discounts recorded for this previous separation had the effect of\\nincreasing our net debt balance by $269 million and we reduced property, plant and equipment by $45 million related to previously capitalized interest.\\nThe prior period consolidated financial statements have not been retrospectively adjusted and continue to be reported under the accounting standards in\\neffect for those periods.\\nNote 3 – Digital Assets, Net\\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, we purchased and/or received immaterial amounts of digital assets. During the year ended\\nDecember 31, 2023, we recorded an immaterial amount of impairment losses on digital assets. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we recorded\\n$204 million of impairment losses on digital assets and realized gains of $64 million in connection with converting our holdings of digital assets into fiat\\ncurrency. The gains are presented net of impairment losses in Restructuring and other in the consolidated statements of operations. As of December 31,\\n2023 and 2022, the carrying value of our digital assets held reflects cumulative impairment of $204 million.\\nNote 4 – Goodwill and Intangible Assets\\nGoodwill increased $59 million within the automotive segment from $194 million as of December 31, 2022 to $253 million as of December 31, 2023\\nprimarily from a business combination, net of the impact of a divestiture. There were no accumulated impairment losses as of December 31, 2023 and\\n2022.\\nThe net carrying value of our intangible assets decreased from $215 million as of December 31, 2022 to $178 million as of December 31, 2023\\nmainly from amortization.\\nNote 5 – Fair Value of Financial Instruments\\nASC 820, Fair Value Measurements (“ASC 820”) states that fair value is an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an\\nasset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. As such, fair value is a market-based measurement that should\\nbe determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or a liability. The three-tiered fair value hierarchy, which\\nprioritizes which inputs should be used in measuring fair value, is comprised of: (Level I) observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets; (Level\\nII) inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are observable either directly or indirectly and (Level III) unobservable inputs for which there is\\nlittle or no market data. The fair value hierarchy requires the use of observable market data when available in determining fair value.

Under our arrangement with Panasonic, we plan to purchase the full output from their production equipment at negotiated prices. As\\nthe terms of the arrangement convey a finance lease under ASC 842, we account for their production equipment as leased assets when production\\ncommences. We account for each lease and any non-lease components associated with that lease as a single lease component for all asset classes,\\nexcept production equipment classes embedded in supply agreements. This results in us recording the cost of their production equipment within Property,\\nplant and equipment, net, on the consolidated balance sheets with a corresponding liability recorded to debt and finance leases. Depreciation on\\nPanasonic production equipment is computed using the units-of-production method whereby capitalized costs are amortized over the total estimated\\nproductive life of the respective assets. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, we had cumulatively capitalized gross costs of $2.02 billion and $2.01 billion,\\nrespectively, on the consolidated balance sheets in relation to the production equipment under our Panasonic arrangement.\\n73\\nNote 9 – Accrued Liabilities and Other\\nOur accrued liabilities and other current liabilities consisted of the following (in millions):\\nDecember 31,\\n2023\\nDecember 31,\\n2022\\nAccrued purchases (1)\\n$\\n2,721 \\n$\\n2,747 \\nAccrued warranty reserve, current portion\\n1,546 \\n1,025 \\nPayroll and related costs\\n1,325 \\n1,026 \\nTaxes payable (2)\\n1,204 \\n1,235 \\nCustomer deposits\\n876 \\n1,063 \\nOperating lease liabilities, current portion\\n672 \\n485 \\nSales return reserve, current portion\\n219 \\n270 \\nOther current liabilities\\n517 \\n354 \\nTotal\\n$\\n9,080 \\n$\\n8,205 \\n(1)\\nAccrued purchases primarily reflects receipts of goods and services for which we had not yet been invoiced.

Non-recourse debt refers to debt that is recourse to only assets of our\\nsubsidiaries. The differences between the unpaid principal balances and the net carrying values are due to debt discounts or deferred issuance costs. As\\nof December 31, 2023, we were in material compliance with all financial debt covenants.\\n2024 Notes\\nThe closing price of our common stock continued to exceed 130% of the applicable conversion price of our 2024 Notes on at least 20 of the last 30\\nconsecutive trading days of each quarter in 2023, causing the 2024 Notes to be convertible by their holders in the subsequent quarter. As of December\\n31, 2023, the if-converted value of the notes exceeds the outstanding principal amount by $406 million. Upon conversion, the 2024 Notes will be settled\\nin cash, shares of our common stock or a combination thereof, at our election.\\nCredit Agreement\\nIn June 2015, we entered into a senior asset-based revolving credit agreement (as amended from time to time, the “Credit Agreement”) with a\\nsyndicate of banks. Borrowed funds bear interest, at our option, at an annual rate of (a) 1% plus LIBOR or (b) the highest of (i) the federal funds rate plus\\n0.50%, (ii) the lenders’ “prime rate” or (iii) 1% plus LIBOR. The fee for undrawn amounts is 0.25% per annum. The Credit Agreement is secured by certain\\nof our accounts receivable, inventory and equipment. Availability under the Credit Agreement is based on the value of such assets, as reduced by certain\\nreserves.\\nIn January 2023, we entered into a 5-year senior unsecured revolving credit facility (the “RCF Credit Agreement”) with a syndicate of banks to\\nreplace the existing Credit Agreement, which was terminated. The RCF Credit Agreement contains two optional one-year extensions and has a total\\ncommitment of up to $5.00 billion, which could be increased up to $7.00 billion under certain circumstances. The underlying borrowings may be used for\\ngeneral corporate purposes. Borrowed funds accrue interest at a variable rate equal to: (i) for dollar-denominated loans, at our election, (a) Term SOFR\\n(the forward-looking secured overnight financing rate) plus 0.10%, or (b) an alternate base rate; (ii) for loans denominated in pounds sterling, SONIA (the\\nsterling overnight index average reference rate); or (iii) for loans denominated in euros, an adjusted EURIBOR (euro interbank offered rate); in each case,\\nplus an applicable margin. The applicable margin will be based on the rating assigned to our senior, unsecured long-term indebtedness (the “Credit\\nRating”) from time to time. The fee for undrawn amounts is variable based on the Credit Rating and is currently 0.125% per annum.\\n75\\nAutomotive Asset-backed Notes\\nFrom time to time, we transfer receivables and/or beneficial interests related to certain vehicles (either leased or financed) into special purpose\\nentities (“SPEs”) and issue Automotive Asset-backed Notes, backed by these automotive assets to investors. The SPEs are consolidated in the financial\\nstatements. The cash flows generated by these automotive assets are used to service the principal and interest payments on the Automotive Asset-\\nbacked Notes and satisfy the SPEs’ expenses, and any remaining cash is distributed to the owners of the SPEs. We recognize revenue earned from the\\nassociated customer lease or financing contracts in accordance with our revenue recognition policy. The SPEs’ assets and cash flows are not available to\\nour other creditors, and the creditors of the SPEs, including the Automotive Asset-backed Note holders, have no recourse to our other assets.\\nIn 2023, we transferred beneficial interests related to certain leased vehicles and financing receivables into SPEs and issued $3.93 billion in\\naggregate principal amount of Automotive Asset-backed Notes, with terms similar to our other previously issued Automotive Asset-backed Notes. The\\nproceeds from the issuance, net of debt issuance costs, were $3.92 billion.\\nCash Equity Debt\\nIn connection with the cash equity financing deals closed in 2016, our subsidiaries issued $502 million in aggregate principal amount of debt that\\nbears interest at fixed rates. This debt is secured by, among other things, our interests in certain financing funds and is non-recourse to our other assets.\\nAutomotive Lease-backed Credit Facilities\\nIn the third quarter of 2023, we terminated our Automotive Lease-backed Credit Facilities and the previously committed funds are no longer\\navailable for future borrowings.\\nPledged Assets\\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2022, we had pledged or restricted $4.64 billion and $2.02 billion of our assets (consisting principally of operating\\nlease vehicles, financing receivables, restricted cash, and equity interests in certain SPEs) as collateral for our outstanding debt.\\nSchedule of Principal Maturities of Debt\\nThe future scheduled principal maturities of debt as of December 31, 2023 were as follows (in millions):\\nRecourse debt\\nNon-recourse debt\\nTotal\\n2024\\n$\\n37 \\n$\\n1,941 \\n$\\n1,978 \\n2025\\n4 \\n1,663 \\n1,667 \\n2026\\n— \\n494 \\n494 \\n2027\\n— \\n276 \\n276 \\n2028\\n— \\n44 \\n44 \\nThereafter\\n3 \\n221 \\n224 \\nTotal\\n$\\n44 \\n$\\n4,639 \\n$\\n4,683 \\nNote 12 – Leases\\nWe have entered into various operating and finance lease agreements for certain of our offices, manufacturing and warehouse facilities, retail and\\nservice locations, data centers, equipment, vehicles, and solar energy systems, worldwide. We determine if an arrangement is a lease, or contains a\\nlease, at inception and record the leases in our financial statements upon lease commencement, which is the date when the underlying asset is made\\navailable for use by the lessor.\\nWe have lease agreements with lease and non-lease components, and have elected to utilize the practical expedient to account for lease and non-\\nlease components together as a single combined lease component, from both a lessee and lessor perspective with the exception of direct sales-type\\nleases and production equipment classes embedded in supply agreements. From a lessor perspective, the timing and pattern of transfer are the same for\\nthe non-lease components and associated lease component and, the lease component, if accounted for separately, would be classified as an operating\\nlease.\\n76\\nWe have elected not to present short-term leases on the consolidated balance sheet as these leases have a lease term of 12 months or less at lease\\ninception and do not contain purchase options or renewal terms that we are reasonably certain to exercise. All other lease assets and lease liabilities are\\nrecognized based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term at commencement date. Because most of our leases do not provide an\\nimplicit rate of return, we used our incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at lease commencement date in determining the\\npresent value of lease payments.\\nOur leases, where we are the lessee, often include options to extend the lease term for up to 10 years. Some of our leases also include options to\\nterminate the lease prior to the end of the agreed upon lease term. For purposes of calculating lease liabilities, lease terms include options to extend or\\nterminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise such options.\\nLease expense for operating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term as cost of revenues or operating expenses depending\\non the nature of the leased asset. Certain operating leases provide for annual increases to lease payments based on an index or rate. We calculate the\\npresent value of future lease payments based on the index or rate at the lease commencement date for new leases. Differences between the calculated\\nlease payment and actual payment are expensed as incurred. Amortization of finance lease assets is recognized over the lease term as cost of revenues\\nor operating expenses depending on the nature of the leased asset. Interest expense on finance lease liabilities is recognized over the lease term within\\nInterest expense in the consolidated statements of operations.\\nThe balances for the operating and finance leases where we are the lessee are presented as follows (in millions) within our consolidated balance\\nsheets:\\nDecember 31, 2023\\nDecember 31, 2022\\nOperating leases:\\n \\n \\nOperating lease right-of-use assets\\n$\\n4,180 \\n$\\n2,563 \\n \\nAccrued liabilities and other\\n$\\n672 \\n$\\n485 \\nOther long-term liabilities\\n3,671 \\n2,164 \\nTotal operating lease liabilities\\n$\\n4,343 \\n$\\n2,649 \\n \\nFinance leases:\\n \\n \\nSolar energy systems, net\\n$\\n23 \\n$\\n25 \\nProperty, plant and equipment, net\\n601 \\n1,094 \\nTotal finance lease assets\\n$\\n624 \\n$\\n1,119 \\n \\nCurrent portion of long-term debt and finance leases\\n$\\n398 \\n$\\n486 \\nLong-term debt and finance leases, net of current portion\\n175 \\n568 \\nTotal finance lease liabilities\\n$\\n573 \\n$\\n1,054 \\n77\\nThe components of lease expense are as follows (in millions) within our consolidated statements of operations:\\nYear Ended December 31,\\n2023\\n2022\\n2021\\nOperating lease expense:\\n \\n \\n \\nOperating lease expense (1)\\n$\\n1,153 \\n$\\n798 \\n$\\n627 \\n \\nFinance lease expense:\\nAmortization of leased assets\\n$\\n506 \\n$\\n493 \\n$\\n415 \\nInterest on lease liabilities\\n45 \\n72 \\n89 \\nTotal finance lease expense\\n$\\n551 \\n$\\n565 \\n$\\n504 \\n \\nTotal lease expense\\n$\\n1,704 \\n$\\n1,363 \\n$\\n1,131 \\n(1)\\nIncludes short-term leases and variable lease costs, which are immaterial.\\nOther information related to leases where we are the lessee is as follows:\\nDecember 31, 2023\\nDecember 31, 2022\\nWeighted-average remaining lease term:\\nOperating leases\\n7.4 years\\n6.4 years\\nFinance leases\\n2.3 years\\n3.1 years\\n \\nWeighted-average discount rate:\\nOperating leases\\n5.6 %\\n5.3 %\\nFinance leases\\n5.5 %\\n5.7 %\\nSupplemental cash flow information related to leases where we are the lessee is as follows (in millions):\\nYear Ended December 31,\\n2023\\n2022\\n2021\\nCash paid for amounts included in the measurement of lease liabilities:\\nOperating cash outflows from operating leases\\n$\\n1,084 \\n$\\n754 \\n$\\n616 \\nOperating cash outflows from finance leases (interest payments)\\n$\\n47 \\n$\\n75 \\n$\\n89 \\nLeased assets obtained in exchange for finance lease liabilities\\n$\\n10 \\n$\\n58 \\n$\\n486 \\nLeased assets obtained in exchange for operating lease liabilities\\n$\\n2,170 \\n$\\n1,059 \\n$\\n818 \\n78\\nAs of December 31, 2023, the maturities of our operating and finance lease liabilities (excluding short-term leases) are as follows (in millions):\\n \\nOperating\\nLeases\\nFinance\\nLeases\\n2024\\n$\\n892 \\n$\\n418 \\n2025\\n831 \\n81 \\n2026\\n706 \\n57 \\n2027\\n603 \\n38 \\n2028\\n508 \\n2 \\nThereafter\\n1,820 \\n4 \\nTotal minimum lease payments\\n5,360 \\n600 \\nLess: Interest\\n1,017 \\n27 \\nPresent value of lease obligations\\n4,343 \\n573 \\nLess: Current portion\\n672 \\n398 \\nLong-term portion of lease obligations\\n$\\n3,671 \\n$\\n175 \\nAs of December 31, 2023, we have excluded from the table above additional operating leases that have not yet commenced with aggregate rent\\npayments of $1.53 billion.

The 2019 Plan provides for the grant of stock options, restricted stock,\\nRSUs, stock appreciation rights, performance units and performance shares to our employees, directors and consultants. Stock options granted under the\\n2019 Plan may be either incentive stock options or nonstatutory stock options. Incentive stock options may only be granted to our employees.\\nNonstatutory stock options may be granted to our employees, directors and consultants. Generally, our stock options and RSUs vest over four years and\\nour stock options are exercisable over a maximum period of 10 years from their grant dates. Vesting typically terminates when the employment or\\nconsulting relationship ends.\\nAs of December 31, 2023, 131.1 million shares were reserved and available for issuance under the 2019 Plan.\\n80\\nThe following table summarizes our stock option and RSU activity for the year ended December 31, 2023:\\nStock Options\\nRSUs\\nNumber of\\nOptions\\n(in thousands)\\nWeighted-\\nAverage\\nExercise\\nPrice\\nWeighted-\\nAverage\\nRemaining\\nContractual\\nLife (years)\\nAggregate\\nIntrinsic\\nValue\\n(in billions)\\nNumber\\nof RSUs\\n(in thousands)\\nWeighted-\\nAverage\\nGrant\\nDate Fair\\nValue\\nBeginning of period\\n343,564\\n$\\n30.65 \\n21,333\\n$\\n162.32 \\nGranted\\n9,521\\n$\\n226.50 \\n11,743\\n$\\n228.33 \\nExercised or released\\n(7,626)\\n$\\n43.07 \\n(11,085)\\n$\\n116.47 \\nCancelled\\n(1,438)\\n$\\n194.23 \\n(2,903)\\n$\\n192.22 \\nEnd of period\\n344,021\\n$\\n35.11 \\n4.31\\n$\\n73.57 \\n19,088\\n$\\n225.01 \\nVested and expected to vest, December 31, 2023\\n340,884\\n$\\n33.38 \\n4.27\\n$\\n73.45 \\n18,446\\n$\\n225.76 \\nExercisable and vested, December 31, 2023\\n329,124\\n$\\n27.07 \\n4.11\\n$\\n72.90 \\nThe weighted-average grant date fair value of RSUs granted in the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 was $228.33, $239.85 and\\n$261.33, respectively. The aggregate release date fair value of RSUs in the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 was $2.50 billion, $4.32\\nbillion and $5.70 billion, respectively.\\nThe aggregate intrinsic value of options exercised in the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021 was $1.33 billion, $1.90 billion and\\n$26.88 billion, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2021, our CEO exercised all of the remaining vested options from the 2012 CEO\\nPerformance Award, which amounted to an intrinsic value of $23.45 billion.\\nESPP\\nOur employees are eligible to purchase our common stock through payroll deductions of up to 15% of their eligible compensation, subject to any\\nplan limitations. The purchase price would be 85% of the lower of the fair market value on the first and last trading days of each six-month offering\\nperiod. During the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, under the ESPP we issued 2.1 million, 1.4 million and 1.5 million shares, respectively.\\nAs of December 31, 2023, there were 97.8 million shares available for issuance under the ESPP.\\nFair Value Assumptions\\nWe use the fair value method in recognizing stock-based compensation expense. Under the fair value method, we estimate the fair value of each\\nstock option award with service or service and performance conditions and the ESPP on the grant date generally using the Black-Scholes option pricing\\nmodel. The weighted-average assumptions used in the Black-Scholes model for stock options are as follows:\\nYear Ended December 31,\\n2023\\n2022\\n2021\\nRisk-free interest rate\\n3.90 %\\n3.11 %\\n0.66 %\\nExpected term (in years)\\n4.5\\n4.1\\n4.3\\nExpected volatility\\n63 %\\n63 %\\n59 %\\nDividend yield\\n0.0 %\\n0.0 %\\n0.0 %\\nGrant date fair value per share\\n$\\n121.62 \\n$\\n114.51 \\n$\\n128.02 \\nThe fair value of RSUs with service or service and performance conditions is measured on the grant date based on the closing fair market value of\\nour common stock. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield for zero-coupon U.S. Treasury notes with maturities approximating each\\ngrant’s expected life. We use our historical data in estimating the expected term of our employee grants. The expected volatility is based on the average\\nof the implied volatility of publicly traded options for our common stock and the historical volatility of our common stock.\\n81\\n2018 CEO Performance Award\\nIn March 2018, our stockholders approved the Board of Directors’ grant of 304.0 million stock option awards, as adjusted to give effect to the 2020\\nStock Split and the 2022 Stock Split, to our CEO (the “2018 CEO Performance Award”). The 2018 CEO Performance Award consisted of 12 vesting\\ntranches with a vesting schedule based entirely on the attainment of both operational milestones (performance conditions) and market conditions,\\nassuming continued employment either as the CEO or as both Executive Chairman and Chief Product Officer and service through each vesting date. Each\\nof the 12 vesting tranches of the 2018 CEO Performance Award vested upon certification by the Board of Directors that both (i) the market capitalization\\nmilestone for such tranche, which began at $100.0 billion for the first tranche and increases by increments of $50.0 billion thereafter (based on both a six\\ncalendar month trailing average and a 30 calendar day trailing average, counting only trading days), had been achieved, and (ii) any one of the following\\neight operational milestones focused on total revenue or any one of the eight operational milestones focused on Adjusted EBITDA had been achieved for\\nthe four consecutive fiscal quarters on an annualized basis and subsequently reported by us in our consolidated financial statements filed with our Forms\\n10-Q and/or 10-K. Adjusted EBITDA was defined as net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders before interest expense, provision (benefit) for\\nincome taxes, depreciation and amortization and stock-based compensation. Upon vesting and exercise, including the payment of the exercise price of\\n$23.34 per share as adjusted to give effect to the 2020 Stock Split and the 2022 Stock Split, our CEO must hold shares that he acquires for five years\\npost-exercise, other than a cashless exercise where shares are simultaneously sold to pay for the exercise price and any required tax withholding.\\nThe achievement status of the operational milestones as of December 31, 2023 is provided below.\\nTotal Annualized Revenue\\nAnnualized Adjusted EBITDA\\nMilestone\\n(in billions)\\nAchievement Status\\nMilestone\\n(in billions)\\nAchievement Status\\n$\\n20.0 \\nAchieved\\n$\\n1.5 \\nAchieved\\n$\\n35.0 \\nAchieved\\n$\\n3.0 \\nAchieved\\n$\\n55.0 \\nAchieved\\n$\\n4.5 \\nAchieved\\n$\\n75.0 \\nAchieved\\n$\\n6.0 \\nAchieved\\n$\\n100.0 \\n-\\n$\\n8.0 \\nAchieved\\n$\\n125.0 \\n-\\n$\\n10.0 \\nAchieved\\n$\\n150.0 \\n-\\n$\\n12.0 \\nAchieved\\n$\\n175.0 \\n-\\n$\\n14.0 \\nAchieved\\nStock-based compensation under the 2018 CEO Performance Award represented a non-cash expense and was recorded as a Selling, general, and\\nadministrative operating expense in our consolidated statements of operations. In each quarter since the grant of the 2018 CEO Performance Award, we\\nhad recognized expense, generally on a pro-rated basis, for only the number of tranches (up to the maximum of 12 tranches) that corresponded to the\\nnumber of operational milestones that had been achieved or had been determined probable of being achieved in the future, in accordance with the\\nfollowing principles.\\nOn the grant date, a Monte Carlo simulation was used to determine for each tranche (i) a fixed amount of expense for such tranche and (ii) the\\nfuture time when the market capitalization milestone for such tranche was expected to be achieved, or its “expected market capitalization milestone\\nachievement time.” Separately, based on a subjective assessment of our future financial performance each quarter, we determined whether it was\\nprobable that we would achieve each operational milestone that had not previously been achieved or deemed probable of achievement and if so, the\\nfuture time when we expected to achieve that operational milestone, or its “expected operational milestone achievement time.”\\nAs of December 31, 2022, all remaining unrecognized stock-based compensation expense under the 2018 CEO Performance Award had been\\nrecognized. For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we recorded stock-based compensation expense of $66 million and $910 million,\\nrespectively, related to the 2018 CEO Performance Award.\\n82\\nOther Performance-Based Grants\\nFrom time to time, the Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors grants certain employees performance-based RSUs and stock options.\\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had unrecognized stock-based compensation expense of $655 million under these grants to purchase or receive an\\naggregate 5.3 million shares of our common stock. For awards probable of achievement, we estimate the unrecognized stock-based compensation\\nexpense of $110 million will be recognized over a weighted-average period of 4.0 years.\\nFor the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, we recorded $57 million and $159 million, respectively, of stock-based compensation expense\\nrelated to these grants, net of forfeitures.\\nSummary Stock-Based Compensation Information\\nThe following table summarizes our stock-based compensation expense by line item in the consolidated statements of operations (in millions):\\nYear Ended December 31,\\n2023\\n2022\\n2021\\nCost of revenues\\n$\\n741 \\n$\\n594 \\n$\\n421 \\nResearch and development\\n689 \\n536 \\n448 \\nSelling, general and administrative\\n382 \\n430 \\n1,252 \\nTotal\\n$\\n1,812 \\n$\\n1,560 \\n$\\n2,121 \\nOur income tax benefits recognized from stock-based compensation arrangements were immaterial while we were under full valuation allowances\\non our U.S. deferred tax assets during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. With the release of the valuation allowance associated with our\\nfederal and certain state deferred tax assets in 2023, income tax benefits recognized from stock-based compensation expense were $326 million during\\nthe year ended December 31, 2023. During the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, stock-based compensation expense capitalized to our\\nconsolidated balance sheets was $199 million, $245 million and $182 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2023, we had $4.82 billion of total\\nunrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to non-performance awards, which will be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.8\\nyears.\\nNote 14 – Income Taxes\\nOur income before (benefit from) provision for income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 was as follows (in millions):\\nYear Ended December 31,\\n2023\\n2022\\n2021\\nDomestic\\n$\\n3,196 \\n$\\n5,524 \\n$\\n(130)\\nNoncontrolling interest and redeemable noncontrolling interest\\n(23)\\n31 \\n125 \\nForeign\\n6,800 \\n8,164 \\n6,348 \\nIncome before income taxes\\n$\\n9,973 \\n$\\n13,719 \\n$\\n6,343 \\n83\\nA (benefit from) provision for income taxes of $(5.00) billion, $1.13 billion and $699 million has been recognized for the years ended December 31,\\n2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

As of December 31, 2023,\\nbased on the relevant weight of positive and negative evidence, including the amount of our taxable income in recent years which is objective and\\nverifiable, and consideration of our expected future taxable earnings, we concluded that it is more likely than not that our U.S. federal and certain state\\ndeferred tax assets are realizable. As such, we released $6.54 billion of our valuation allowance associated with the U.S. federal and state deferred tax\\nassets, with the exception of our California deferred tax assets. We continue to maintain a full valuation allowance against our California deferred tax\\nassets as of December 31, 2023, because we concluded they are not more likely than not to be realized as we expect our California deferred tax assets\\ngeneration in future years to exceed our ability to use these deferred tax assets.\\n84\\nDeferred tax assets (liabilities) as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 consisted of the following (in millions):\\nDecember 31,\\n2023\\nDecember 31,\\n2022\\nDeferred tax assets:\\nNet operating loss carry-forwards\\n$\\n2,826 \\n$\\n4,486 \\nResearch and development credits\\n1,358 \\n1,184 \\nOther tax credits and attributes\\n827 \\n217 \\nDeferred revenue\\n1,035 \\n751 \\nInventory and warranty reserves\\n1,258 \\n819 \\nStock-based compensation\\n230 \\n185 \\nOperating lease right-of-use liabilities\\n930 \\n554 \\nCapitalized research and development costs\\n1,344 \\n693 \\nDeferred GILTI tax assets\\n760 \\n466 \\nAccruals and others\\n206 \\n178 \\nTotal deferred tax assets\\n10,774 \\n9,533 \\nValuation allowance\\n(892)\\n(7,349)\\nDeferred tax assets, net of valuation allowance\\n9,882 \\n2,184 \\nDeferred tax liabilities:\\nDepreciation and amortization\\n(2,122)\\n(1,178)\\nInvestment in certain financing funds\\n(133)\\n(238)\\nOperating lease right-of-use assets\\n(859)\\n(506)\\nOther\\n(116)\\n(15)\\nTotal deferred tax liabilities\\n(3,230)\\n(1,937)\\nDeferred tax assets (liabilities), net of valuation allowance\\n$\\n6,652 \\n$\\n247 \\nAs of December 31, 2023, we maintained valuation allowances of $892 million for deferred tax assets that are not more likely than not to be\\nrealized, which primarily included deferred tax assets in the state of California and certain foreign operating losses. The valuation allowance on our net\\ndeferred tax assets decreased by $6.46 billion and $1.73 billion during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and increased by\\n$6.14 billion during the year ended December 31, 2021. The valuation allowance decrease during the year ended December 31, 2023 was primarily due\\nto the release of our valuation allowance with respect to our U.S. federal and certain state deferred tax assets. The changes in valuation allowances\\nduring the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 were primarily due to changes in our U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities in the respective year.\\nAmong our deferred tax assets in foreign jurisdictions, we recorded a valuation allowance on certain foreign net operating losses that are not more likely\\nthan not to be realized. The remainder of our foreign deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be realized given the expectation of future earnings\\nin these jurisdictions.\\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had $10.31 billion of federal and $10.36 billion of state net operating loss carry-forwards available to offset future\\ntaxable income, some of which, if not utilized, will begin to expire in 2024 for federal and state purposes. Federal and state laws can impose substantial\\nrestrictions on the utilization of net operating loss and tax credit carry-forwards in the event of an “ownership change,” as defined in Section 382 of the\\nInternal Revenue Code. We have determined that no significant limitation would be placed on the utilization of our net operating loss and tax credit carry-\\nforwards due to prior ownership changes or expirations.\\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had federal research and development tax credits of $1.10 billion, federal renewable energy tax credits of\\n$605 million, and state research and development tax credits of $923 million. Most of our state research and development tax credits were in the state of\\nCalifornia. If not utilized, some of the federal tax credits may expire in various amounts beginning in 2036. However, California research and development\\ntax credits can be carried forward indefinitely.\\n85\\nThe local government of Shanghai granted a beneficial corporate income tax rate of 15% to certain eligible enterprises, compared to the 25%\\nstatutory corporate income tax rate in China. Our Gigafactory Shanghai subsidiary was granted this beneficial income tax rate of 15% for 2019 through\\n2023. Starting in 2024, Gigafactory Shanghai is subject to 25% statutory corporate income tax rate in China.\\nAs of December 31, 2023, we intend to indefinitely reinvest our foreign earnings and cash unless such repatriation results in no or minimal tax costs.\\nWe have recorded the taxes associated with the foreign earnings we intend to repatriate in the future. For the earnings we intend to indefinitely reinvest,\\nno deferred tax liabilities for foreign withholding or other taxes have been recorded. The estimated amount of such unrecognized withholding tax liability\\nassociated with the indefinitely reinvested earnings is approximately $245 million.\\nUncertain Tax Positions\\nThe changes to our gross unrecognized tax benefits were as follows (in millions):\\nDecember 31, 2020\\n$\\n380 \\nIncreases in balances related to prior year tax positions\\n117 \\nDecreases in balances related to prior year tax positions\\n(90)\\nIncreases in balances related to current year tax positions\\n124 \\nDecember 31, 2021\\n531 \\nIncreases in balances related to prior year tax positions\\n136 \\nDecreases in balances related to prior year tax positions\\n(12)\\nIncreases in balances related to current year tax positions\\n222 \\nDecreases in balances related to expiration of the statute of limitations\\n(7)\\nDecember 31, 2022\\n870 \\nIncreases in balances related to prior year tax positions\\n59 \\nDecreases related to settlement with tax authorities\\n(6)\\nIncreases in balances related to current year tax positions\\n255 \\nDecreases in balances related to expiration of the statute of limitations\\n(4)\\nDecember 31, 2023\\n$\\n1,174 \\nWe include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.

As of December 31, 2023, and 2022, we have accrued $47 million and $31 million,\\nrespectively, related to interest and penalties on our unrecognized tax benefits. Unrecognized tax benefits of $901 million, if recognized, would affect our\\neffective tax rate.\\nWe file income tax returns in the U.S. and various state and foreign jurisdictions. We are currently under examination by the Internal Revenue\\nService (“IRS”) for the years 2015 to 2018. Additional tax years within the periods 2004 to 2014 and 2019 to 2022 remain subject to examination for\\nfederal income tax purposes. All net operating losses and tax credits generated to date are subject to adjustment for U.S. federal and state income tax\\npurposes. Our returns for 2004 and subsequent tax years remain subject to examination in U.S. state and foreign jurisdictions.\\nGiven the uncertainty in timing and outcome of our tax examinations, an estimate of the range of the reasonably possible change in gross\\nunrecognized tax benefits within twelve months cannot be made at this time.\\nNote 15 – Commitments and Contingencies\\nOperating Lease Arrangement in Buffalo, New York\\nWe have an operating lease arrangement through the Research Foundation for the SUNY Foundation with respect to Gigafactory New York. Under\\nthe lease and a related research and development agreement, we are continuing to further develop the facility.\\n86\\nUnder this agreement, we are obligated to, among other things, meet employment targets as well as specified minimum numbers of personnel in\\nthe State of New York and in Buffalo, New York and spend or incur $5.00 billion in combined capital, operational expenses, costs of goods sold and other\\ncosts in the State of New York during the 10-year period beginning April 30, 2018. On an annual basis during the initial lease term, as measured on each\\nanniversary of such date, if we fail to meet these specified investment and job creation requirements, then we would be obligated to pay a $41 million\\n“program payment” to the SUNY Foundation for each year that we fail to meet these requirements. Furthermore, if the arrangement is terminated due to\\na material breach by us, then additional amounts may become payable by us.\\nIn 2021, an amendment was executed to extend our overall agreement to spend or incur $5.00 billion in combined capital, operational expenses,\\ncosts of goods sold and other costs in the State of New York through December 31, 2029. On February 1, 2022, we reported to the State of New York that\\nwe had met and exceeded our annual requirements for jobs and investment in Buffalo and New York State. As of December 31, 2023, we have met and\\nexpect to meet the requirements under this arrangement based on our current and anticipated level of operations. However, if our expectations as to the\\ncosts and timelines of our investment and operations at Buffalo prove incorrect, we may incur additional expenses or be required to make substantial\\npayments to the SUNY Foundation.\\nOperating Lease Arrangement in Shanghai, China\\nWe have an operating lease arrangement for an initial term of 50 years with the local government of Shanghai for land use rights where we have\\nbeen constructing Gigafactory Shanghai. Under the terms of the arrangement, we are required to spend RMB 14.08 billion in capital expenditures by the\\nend of 2023, which has been achieved in 2023, and to generate RMB 2.23 billion of annual tax revenues starting at the end of 2023. As of December 31,\\n2023, we have met and expect to meet the tax revenue requirements based on our current level of spend and sales.\\nLegal Proceedings\\nLitigation Relating to 2018 CEO Performance Award\\nOn June 4, 2018, a purported Tesla stockholder filed a putative class and derivative action in the Delaware Court of Chancery against Elon Musk and\\nthe members of Tesla’s board of directors as then constituted, alleging corporate waste, unjust enrichment and that such board members breached their\\nfiduciary duties by approving the stock-based compensation plan awarded to Elon Musk in 2018. Trial was held November 14-18, 2022. Post-trial briefing\\nand argument are now complete.\\nLitigation Related to Directors’ Compensation\\nOn June 17, 2020, a purported Tesla stockholder filed a derivative action in the Delaware Court of Chancery, purportedly on behalf of Tesla, against\\ncertain of Tesla’s current and former directors regarding compensation awards granted to Tesla’s directors, other than Elon Musk, between 2017 and\\n2020. The suit asserts claims for breach of fiduciary duty and unjust enrichment and seeks declaratory and injunctive relief, unspecified damages and\\nother relief. Defendants filed their answer on September 17, 2020.\\nOn July 14, 2023, the parties filed a Stipulation and Agreement of Compromise and Settlement, which does not involve an admission of any\\nwrongdoing by any party. If the settlement is approved by the Court, this action will be fully settled and dismissed with prejudice. Pursuant to the terms of\\nthe agreement, Tesla provided notice of the proposed settlement to stockholders of record as of July 14, 2023. The Court held a hearing regarding the\\nsettlement on October 13, 2023, after which it took the settlement and plaintiff counsels’ fee request under advisement. The settlement is not expected\\nto have an adverse impact on our results of operations, cash flows or financial position.\\nLitigation Relating to Potential Going Private Transaction\\nBetween August 10, 2018 and September 6, 2018, nine purported stockholder class actions were filed against Tesla and Elon Musk in connection\\nwith Mr. Musk’s August 7, 2018 Twitter post that he was considering taking Tesla private. On January 16, 2019, Plaintiffs filed their consolidated complaint\\nin the United States District Court for the Northern District of California and added as defendants the members of Tesla’s board of directors. The\\nconsolidated complaint asserts claims for violations of the federal securities laws and seeks unspecified damages and other relief. The parties stipulated\\nto certification of a class of stockholders, which the court granted on November 25, 2020. Trial started on January 17, 2023, and on February 3, 2023, a\\njury rendered a verdict in favor of the defendants on all counts. After trial, plaintiffs filed a motion for judgment as a matter of law and a motion for new\\ntrial, which the Court denied and judgement was entered in favor of defendants on July 11, 2023. On July 14, 2023, plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal.\\n87\\nBetween October 17, 2018 and March 8, 2021, seven derivative lawsuits were filed in the Delaware Court of Chancery, purportedly on behalf of\\nTesla, against Mr. Musk and the members of Tesla’s board of directors, as constituted at relevant times, in relation to statements made and actions\\nconnected to a potential going private transaction, with certain of the lawsuits challenging additional Twitter posts by Mr. Musk, among other things. Five\\nof those actions were consolidated, and all seven actions have been stayed pending resolution of the appeal in the above-referenced consolidated\\npurported stockholder class action. In addition to these cases, two derivative lawsuits were filed on October 25, 2018 and February 11, 2019 in the U.S.\\nDistrict Court for the District of Delaware, purportedly on behalf of Tesla, against Mr. Musk and the members of the Tesla board of directors as then\\nconstituted. Those cases have also been consolidated and stayed pending resolution of the appeal in the above-referenced consolidated purported\\nstockholder class action.\\nOn October 21, 2022, a lawsuit was filed in the Delaware Court of Chancery by a purported shareholder of Tesla alleging, among other things, that\\nboard members breached their fiduciary duties in connection with their oversight of the Company’s 2018 settlement with the SEC, as amended. Among\\nother things, the plaintiff seeks reforms to the Company’s corporate governance and internal procedures, unspecified damages, and attorneys’ fees. The\\nparties reached an agreement to stay the case until March 5, 2024.\\nOn November 15, 2021, JPMorgan Chase Bank (“JP Morgan”) filed a lawsuit against Tesla in the Southern District of New York alleging breach of a\\nstock warrant agreement that was entered into as part of a convertible notes offering in 2014. In 2018, JP Morgan informed Tesla that it had adjusted the\\nstrike price based upon Mr. Musk’s August 7, 2018 Twitter post that he was considering taking Tesla private. Tesla disputed JP Morgan’s adjustment as a\\nviolation of the parties’ agreement. In 2021, Tesla delivered shares to JP Morgan per the agreement, which they duly accepted. JP Morgan now alleges\\nthat it is owed approximately $162 million as the value of additional shares that it claims should have been delivered as a result of the adjustment to the\\nstrike price in 2018. On January 24, 2022, Tesla filed multiple counterclaims as part of its answer to the underlying lawsuit, asserting among other points\\nthat JP Morgan should have terminated the stock warrant agreement in 2018 rather than make an adjustment to the strike price that it should have\\nknown would lead to a commercially unreasonable result. Tesla believes that the adjustments made by JP Morgan were neither proper nor commercially\\nreasonable, as required under the stock warrant agreements. JP Morgan filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings, which Tesla opposed, and that\\nmotion is currently pending before the Court.\\nLitigation and Investigations Relating to Alleged Discrimination and Harassment\\nOn October 4, 2021, in a case captioned Diaz v. Tesla, a jury in the Northern District of California returned a verdict against Tesla on claims by a\\nformer contingent worker that he was subjected to race discrimination while assigned to work at Tesla’s Fremont Factory from 2015-2016. A retrial was\\nheld starting on March 27, 2023, after which a jury returned a verdict of $3,175,000. As a result, the damages awarded against Tesla were reduced from\\nan initial $136.9 million (October 4, 2021) down to $15 million (April 13, 2022), and then further down to $3.175 million (April 3, 2023). On November 2,\\n2023, the plaintiff filed a notice of appeal, and on November 16, 2023, Tesla filed a notice of cross appeal.\\nOn February 9, 2022, shortly after the first Diaz jury verdict, the California Civil Rights Department (“CRD,” formerly “DFEH”) filed a civil complaint\\nagainst Tesla in Alameda County, California Superior Court, alleging systemic race discrimination, hostile work environment and pay equity claims, among\\nothers. CRD’s amended complaint seeks monetary damages and injunctive relief. On September 22, 2022, Tesla filed a cross complaint against CRD,\\nalleging that it violated the Administrative Procedures Act by failing to follow statutory pre-requisites prior to filing suit and that cross complaint was\\nsubject to a sustained demurrer, which Tesla later amended and refiled. The case is currently in discovery.\\nAdditionally, on June 1, 2022 the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) issued a cause finding against Tesla that closely parallels the\\nCRD’s allegations. On September 28, 2023, the EEOC filed a civil complaint against Tesla in the United States District Court for the Northern District of\\nCalifornia asserting claims for race harassment and retaliation and seeking, among other things, monetary and injunctive relief. On December 18, 2023,\\nTesla filed a motion to stay the case. Separately, on December 26, 2023, Tesla filed a motion to dismiss the case.\\nOn June 16, 2022, two Tesla stockholders filed separate derivative actions in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas, purportedly on\\nbehalf of Tesla, against certain of Tesla’s current and former directors. Both suits assert claims for breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, and\\nviolation of the federal securities laws in connection with alleged race and gender discrimination and sexual harassment. Among other things, plaintiffs\\nseek declaratory and injunctive relief, unspecified damages payable to Tesla, and attorneys’ fees. On July 22, 2022, the Court consolidated the two cases\\nand on September 6, 2022, plaintiffs filed a consolidated complaint. On November 7, 2022, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the case and on\\nSeptember 15, 2023, the Court dismissed the action but granted plaintiffs leave to file an amended complaint. On November 2, 2023, plaintiff filed an\\namended complaint purportedly on behalf of Tesla, against Elon Musk. On December 19, 2023, the defendants moved to dismiss the amended complaint.\\n88\\nOther Litigation Related to Our Products and Services\\nWe are also subject to various lawsuits that seek monetary and other injunctive relief. These lawsuits include proposed class actions and other\\nconsumer claims that allege, among other things, purported defects and misrepresentations related to our products and services. For example, on\\nSeptember 14, 2022, a proposed class action was filed against Tesla, Inc. and related entities in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of\\nCalifornia, alleging various claims about the Company’s driver assistance technology systems under state and federal law. This case was later\\nconsolidated with several other proposed class actions, and a Consolidated Amended Complaint was filed on October 28, 2022, which seeks damages and\\nother relief on behalf of all persons who purchased or leased from Tesla between January 1, 2016 to the present. On October 5, 2022 a proposed class\\naction complaint was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York asserting similar state and federal law claims against the same\\ndefendants. On September 30, 2023, the Court dismissed this action with leave to amend the complaint. On November 20, 2023, the plaintiff moved to\\namend the complaint, which Tesla opposed. On March 22, 2023, the plaintiffs in the Northern District of California consolidated action filed a motion for a\\npreliminary injunction to order Tesla to (1) cease using the term “Full Self-Driving Capability” (FSD Capability), (2) cease the sale and activation of FSD\\nCapability and deactivate FSD Capability on Tesla vehicles, and (3) provide certain notices to consumers about proposed court-findings about the\\naccuracy of the use of the terms Autopilot and FSD Capability. Tesla opposed the motion. On September 30, 2023, the Court denied the request for a\\npreliminary injunction, compelled four of five plaintiffs to arbitration, and dismissed the claims of the fifth plaintiff with leave to amend the complaint. On\\nOctober 31, 2023, the remaining plaintiff in the Northern District of California action filed an amended complaint, which Tesla has moved to dismiss. On\\nOctober 2, 2023, a similar proposed class action was filed in San Diego County Superior Court in California. Tesla subsequently removed the San Diego\\nCounty case to federal court and on January 8, 2024, the federal court granted Tesla’s motion to transfer the case to the U.S. District Court for the\\nNorthern District of California.\\nOn February 27, 2023, a proposed class action was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California against Tesla, Inc., Elon Musk\\nand certain current and former Company executives. The complaint alleges that the defendants made material misrepresentations and omissions about\\nthe Company’s Autopilot and FSD Capability technologies and seeks money damages and other relief on behalf of persons who purchased Tesla stock\\nbetween February 19, 2019 and February 17, 2023. An amended complaint was filed on September 5, 2023, naming only Tesla, Inc. and Elon Musk as\\ndefendants. On November 6, 2023, Tesla moved to dismiss the amended complaint.\\nOn March 14, 2023, a proposed class action was filed against Tesla, Inc. in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. Several\\nsimilar complaints have also been filed in the same court and these cases have now all been consolidated. These complaints allege that Tesla violates\\nfederal antitrust and warranty laws through its repair, service, and maintenance practices and seeks, among other relief, damages for persons who paid\\nTesla for repairs services or Tesla compatible replacement parts from March 2019 to March 2023. On July 17, 2023, these plaintiffs filed a consolidated\\namended complaint. On September 27, 2023, the court granted Tesla’s motion to compel arbitration as to three of the plaintiffs, and on November 17,\\n2023, the court granted Tesla’s motion to dismiss without prejudice. The plaintiffs filed a Consolidated Second Amended Complaint on December 12,\\n2023, which Tesla has moved to dismiss. Plaintiffs have also appealed the court’s arbitration order. Trial is currently set for July 7, 2025.\\nThe Company intends to vigorously defend itself in these matters; however, we cannot predict the outcome or impact. We are unable to reasonably\\nestimate the possible loss or range of loss, if any, associated with these claims, unless noted.\\nCertain Investigations and Other Matters\\nWe regularly receive requests for information, including subpoenas, from regulators and governmental authorities such as the National Highway\\nTraffic Safety Administration, the National Transportation Safety Board, the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), the Department of Justice\\n(“DOJ”), and various local, state, federal, and international agencies. The ongoing requests for information include topics such as operations, technology\\n(e.g., vehicle functionality, Autopilot and FSD Capability), compliance, finance, data privacy, and other matters related to Tesla’s business, its personnel,\\nand related parties. We routinely cooperate with such formal and informal requests for information, investigations, and other inquiries. To our knowledge\\nno government agency in any ongoing investigation has concluded that any wrongdoing occurred. We cannot predict the outcome or impact of any\\nongoing matters. Should the government decide to pursue an enforcement action, there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on our\\nbusiness, results of operation, prospects, cash flows, financial position or brand.\\n89\\nWe are also subject to various other legal proceedings, risks and claims that arise from the normal course of business activities. For example, during\\nthe second quarter of 2023, a foreign news outlet reported that it obtained certain misappropriated data including, purportedly non-public Tesla business\\nand personal information. Tesla has made notifications to potentially affected individuals (current and former employees) and regulatory authorities and\\nwe are working with certain law enforcement and other authorities. On August 5, 2023, a putative class action was filed in the United States District Court\\nfor the Northern District of California, purportedly on behalf of all U.S. individuals impacted by the data incident, followed by several additional lawsuits,\\nthat each assert claims under various state laws and seeks monetary damages and other relief. If an unfavorable ruling or development were to occur in\\nthese or other possible legal proceedings, risks and claims, there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations,\\nprospects, cash flows, financial position or brand.\\nLetters of Credit\\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had $525 million of unused letters of credit outstanding.\\nNote 16 – Variable Interest Entity Arrangements\\nWe have entered into various arrangements with investors to facilitate the funding and monetization of our solar energy systems and vehicles. In\\nparticular, our wholly owned subsidiaries and fund investors have formed and contributed cash and assets into various financing funds and entered into\\nrelated agreements. We have determined that the funds are VIEs and we are the primary beneficiary of these VIEs by reference to the power and benefits\\ncriterion under ASC 810. We have considered the provisions within the agreements, which grant us the power to manage and make decisions that affect\\nthe operation of these VIEs, including determining the solar energy systems and the associated customer contracts to be sold or contributed to these\\nVIEs, redeploying solar energy systems and managing customer receivables. We consider that the rights granted to the fund investors under the\\nagreements are more protective in nature rather than participating.\\nAs the primary beneficiary of these VIEs, we consolidate in the financial statements the financial position, results of operations and cash flows of\\nthese VIEs, and all intercompany balances and transactions between us and these VIEs are eliminated in the consolidated financial statements. Cash\\ndistributions of income and other receipts by a fund, net of agreed upon expenses, estimated expenses, tax benefits and detriments of income and loss\\nand tax credits, are allocated to the fund investor and our subsidiary as specified in the agreements.\\nGenerally, our subsidiary has the option to acquire the fund investor’s interest in the fund for an amount based on the market value of the fund or\\nthe formula specified in the agreements.\\nUpon the sale or liquidation of a fund, distributions would occur in the order and priority specified in the agreements.\\nPursuant to management services, maintenance and warranty arrangements, we have been contracted to provide services to the funds, such as\\noperations and maintenance support, accounting, lease servicing and performance reporting. In some instances, we have guaranteed payments to the\\nfund investors as specified in the agreements. A fund’s creditors have no recourse to our general credit or to that of other funds. Certain assets of the\\nfunds have been pledged as collateral for their obligations.\\n90\\nThe aggregate carrying values of the VIEs’ assets and liabilities, after elimination of any intercompany transactions and balances, in the\\nconsolidated balance sheets were as follows (in millions):\\nDecember 31,\\n2023\\nDecember 31,\\n2022\\nAssets\\n \\n \\nCurrent assets\\n \\n \\nCash and cash equivalents\\n$\\n66 \\n$\\n68 \\nAccounts receivable, net\\n13 \\n22 \\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets\\n361 \\n274 \\nTotal current assets\\n440 \\n364 \\nSolar energy systems, net\\n3,278 \\n4,060 \\nOther non-current assets\\n369 \\n404 \\nTotal assets\\n$\\n4,087 \\n$\\n4,828 \\nLiabilities\\n \\n \\nCurrent liabilities\\n \\n \\nAccrued liabilities and other\\n$\\n67 \\n$\\n69 \\nDeferred revenue\\n6 \\n10 \\nCurrent portion of debt and finance leases\\n1,564 \\n1,013 \\nTotal current liabilities\\n1,637 \\n1,092 \\nDeferred revenue, net of current portion\\n99 \\n149 \\nDebt and finance leases, net of current portion\\n2,041 \\n971 \\nOther long-term liabilities\\n— \\n3 \\nTotal liabilities\\n$\\n3,777 \\n$\\n2,215 \\nNote 17 – Related Party Transactions\\nIn relation to our CEO’s exercise of stock options and sale of common stock from the 2012 CEO Performance Award, Tesla withheld the appropriate\\namount of taxes. However, given the significant amounts involved, our CEO entered into an indemnification agreement with us in November 2021 for\\nadditional taxes owed, if any.\\nTesla periodically does business with certain entities with which its CEO and directors are affiliated, such as SpaceX and X Corp., in accordance with\\nour Related Person Transactions Policy. Such transactions have not had to date, and are not currently expected to have, a material impact on our\\nconsolidated financial statements.\\n91\\nNote 18 – Segment Reporting and Information about Geographic Areas\\nWe have two operating and reportable segments: (i) automotive and (ii) energy generation and storage. The automotive segment includes the\\ndesign, development, manufacturing, sales and leasing of electric vehicles as well as sales of automotive regulatory credits. Additionally, the automotive\\nsegment is also comprised of services and other, which includes sales of used vehicles, non-warranty after-sales vehicle services, body shop and parts,\\npaid Supercharging, vehicle insurance revenue and retail merchandise.

CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE\\nNone.\\nITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\\nOur management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure\\ncontrols and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a-15 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). In designing and\\nevaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, our management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and\\noperated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures\\nmust reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that our management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible\\ncontrols and procedures relative to their costs.\\nBased on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of December 31, 2023, our disclosure\\ncontrols and procedures were designed at a reasonable assurance level and were effective to provide reasonable assurance that the information we are\\nrequired to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods\\nspecified in the SEC rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive\\nOfficer and our Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.\\nManagement’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial\\nreporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer to provide reasonable assurance\\nregarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted\\naccounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and\\nfairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit\\npreparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made\\nonly in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection\\nof unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\\nUnder the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted\\nan evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework\\n(2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”). Our management concluded that our internal\\ncontrol over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2023.\\nOur independent registered public accounting firm, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, has audited the effectiveness of our internal control over financial\\nreporting as of December 31, 2023, as stated in their report which is included herein.\\nLimitations on the Effectiveness of Controls\\nBecause of inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements and projections of any evaluation\\nof effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of\\ncompliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\\nThere was no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2023, which has\\nmaterially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\\n93\\nITEM 9B.

(the “Company”)\\nbelieves that it is appropriate for the Company to adopt this Clawback Policy (this “Policy”) to be applied to the certain\\nexecutive officers of the Company and adopts this Policy to be effective as of the Effective Date.\\n1. Definitions\\nFor purposes of this Policy, the following definitions shall apply:\\na) “Company Group” means the Company and each of its Subsidiaries, as applicable.\\nb) “Covered Compensation” means any Incentive-Based Compensation Received by a person who served as an\\nExecutive Officer at any time during the performance period for such Incentive-Based Compensation and that was\\nReceived (i) on or after October 2, 2023 and (ii) after the person became an Executive Officer.\\nc) “Effective Date” means November 15, 2023.\\nd) “Erroneously Awarded Compensation” means the amount of Covered Compensation Received by a person during\\nthe fiscal period when the applicable Financial Reporting Measure relating to such Covered Compensation was\\nattained that exceeds the amount of Covered Compensation that otherwise would have been Received by such\\nperson had such amount been determined based on the applicable Restatement, computed without regard to any\\ntaxes paid (i.e., on a pre-tax basis). For Covered Compensation based on stock price or total shareholder return,\\nwhere the amount of Erroneously Awarded Compensation is not subject to mathematical recalculation directly\\nfrom the information in a Restatement, the Committee will determine the amount of such Covered Compensation\\nthat constitutes Erroneously Awarded Compensation, if any, based on a reasonable estimate of the effect of the\\nRestatement on the stock price or total shareholder return upon which the Covered Compensation was granted,\\nvested or paid and the Committee shall maintain documentation of such determination and provide such\\ndocumentation to Nasdaq.\\ne) “Exchange Act” means the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.\\nf)\\n“Executive Officer” means each “executive officer” of the Company (as defined in Rule 10D-1(d) under the\\nExchange Act), which shall be deemed to include any individuals identified by the Company as executive officers\\npursuant to Item 401(b) of Regulation S-K under the Exchange Act. Both current and former Executive Officers\\nare subject to the Policy in accordance with its terms.\\n1\\ng) “Financial Reporting Measure” means (i) any measure that is determined and presented in accordance with the\\naccounting principles used in preparing the Company’s financial statements, and any measures derived wholly or\\nin part from such measures and may consist of GAAP or non-GAAP financial measures (as defined under\\nRegulation G of the Exchange Act and Item 10 of Regulation S-K under the Exchange Act), (ii) stock price or (iii)\\ntotal shareholder return. Financial Reporting Measures may or may not be filed with the SEC and may be\\npresented outside the Company’s financial statements, such as in Managements’ Discussion and Analysis of\\nFinancial Conditions and Result of Operations or in the performance graph required under Item 201(e) of\\nRegulation S-K under the Exchange Act.\\nh) “Incentive-Based Compensation” means any compensation that is granted, earned or vested based wholly or in\\npart upon the attainment of a Financial Reporting Measure.\\ni)\\n“Lookback Period” means the three completed fiscal years (plus any transition period of less than nine months\\nthat is within or immediately following the three completed fiscal years and that results from a change in the\\nCompany’s fiscal year) immediately preceding the date on which the Company is required to prepare a\\nRestatement for a given reporting period, with such date being the earlier of: (i) the date the Board, a committee\\nof the Board, or the officer or officers of the Company authorized to take such action if Board action is not\\nrequired, concludes, or reasonably should have concluded, that the Company is required to prepare a\\nRestatement, or (ii) the date a court, regulator or other legally authorized body directs the Company to prepare a\\nRestatement. Recovery of any Erroneously Awarded Compensation under the Policy is not dependent on if or\\nwhen the Restatement is actually filed.\\nj)\\n“Nasdaq” means the Nasdaq Stock Market.\\nk) “Received”: Incentive-Based Compensation is deemed “Received” in the Company’s fiscal period during which\\nthe Financial Reporting Measure specified in or otherwise relating to the Incentive-Based Compensation award is\\nattained, even if the grant, certification of achievement, vesting or payment of the Incentive-Based Compensation\\noccurs after the end of that period.\\nl)\\n“Restatement” means an accounting restatement required due to the material noncompliance by the Company\\nwith any financial reporting requirement under the securities laws, including (i) to correct an error in previously\\nissued financial statements that is material to the previously issued financial statements (commonly referred to\\nas a “Big R” restatement) or (ii) to correct an error in previously issued financial statements that is not material\\nto the previously issued financial statements but that would result in a material misstatement if the error were\\ncorrected in the current period or left uncorrected in the current period (commonly referred to as a “little r”\\nrestatement). Changes to the Company’s financial statements that do not represent error corrections under the\\nthen-current relevant accounting standards will not constitute Restatements.\\n2\\nm) “SEC” means the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.\\nn) “Subsidiary” means any domestic or foreign corporation, partnership, association, joint stock company, joint\\nventure, trust or unincorporated organization “affiliated” with the Company, that is, directly or indirectly, through\\none or more intermediaries, “controlling”, “controlled by” or “under common control with”, the Company.\\n“Control” for this purpose means the possession, direct or indirect, of the power to direct or cause the direction of\\nthe management and policies of such person, whether through the ownership of voting securities, contract or\\notherwise.\\n2. Recoupment of Erroneously Awarded Compensation\\nIn the event of a Restatement, any Erroneously Awarded Compensation Received during the Lookback Period that (a) is\\nthen-outstanding but has not yet been paid shall be automatically and immediately forfeited or (b) has been paid to any\\nperson shall be subject to reasonably prompt repayment to the Company Group in accordance with Section 3 of this Policy.\\nThe Committee must pursue (and shall not have the discretion to waive) the forfeiture and/or repayment of such\\nErroneously Awarded Compensation in accordance with Section 3 of this Policy, except as provided below. Recovery of any\\nErroneously Awarded Compensation under the Policy is not dependent on fraud or misconduct by any person in connection\\nwith the Restatement.\\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, the Committee (or, if the Committee is not a committee of the Board responsible for the\\nCompany’s executive compensation decisions and composed entirely of independent directors, a majority of the\\nindependent directors serving on the Board) may determine not to pursue the forfeiture and/or recovery of Erroneously\\nAwarded Compensation from any person if the Committee determines that such forfeiture and/or recovery would be\\nimpracticable due to any of the following circumstances: (i) the direct expense paid to a third party (for example,\\nreasonable legal expenses and consulting fees) to assist in enforcing the Policy would exceed the amount to be recovered\\n(following reasonable attempts by the Company Group to recover such Erroneously Awarded Compensation, the\\ndocumentation of such attempts, and the provision of such documentation to the Nasdaq) or (ii) recovery would likely\\ncause any otherwise tax-qualified retirement plan, under which benefits are broadly available to employees of Company\\nGroup, to fail to meet the requirements of 26 U.S.C.\\n401(a)(13) or 26 U.S.C. 411(a) and regulations thereunder.\\n3. Means of Repayment\\nIn the event that the Committee determines that any person shall repay any Erroneously Awarded Compensation, the\\nCommittee shall provide written notice to such person by email or certified mail to the physical address on file with the\\nCompany Group for such person, and the person shall satisfy such repayment in a manner and on such terms as required\\nby the Committee, and the Company Group shall be entitled to set off the repayment amount against any amount owed to\\nthe person by the Company Group, to require the forfeiture of any award granted by the Company Group to the person, or\\nto take any and all necessary actions to reasonably promptly recoup the repayment amount from the person, in each case,\\nto the fullest extent permitted under applicable law, including without limitation, Section 409A of the U.S.\\n3\\nInternal Revenue Code and the regulations and guidance thereunder. If the Committee does not specify a repayment\\ntiming in the written notice described above, the applicable person shall be required to repay the Erroneously Awarded\\nCompensation to the Company Group by wire, cash or cashier’s check no later than thirty (30) days after receipt of such\\nnotice.\\n4. No Indemnification\\nNo person shall be indemnified, insured or reimbursed by the Company Group in respect of any loss of compensation by\\nsuch person in accordance with this Policy, nor shall any person receive any advancement of expenses for disputes related\\nto any loss of compensation by such person in accordance with this Policy, and no person shall be paid or reimbursed by\\nthe Company Group for any premiums paid by such person for any third-party insurance policy covering potential recovery\\nobligations under this Policy.\\n5. Miscellaneous\\nThis Policy generally will be administered and interpreted by the Committee, provided that the Board may, from time to\\ntime, exercise discretion to administer and interpret this Policy, in which case, all references herein to “Committee” shall be\\ndeemed to refer to the Board. Any determination by the Committee with respect to this Policy shall be final, conclusive and\\nbinding on all interested parties. Any discretionary determinations of the Committee under this Policy, if any, need not be\\nuniform with respect to all persons, and may be made selectively amongst persons, whether or not such persons are\\nsimilarly situated.\\nThis Policy is intended to satisfy the requirements of Section 954 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer\\nProtection Act, as it may be amended from time to time, Rule 10D- 1 under the Exchange Act, and any related rules or\\nregulations promulgated by the SEC or the Nasdaq, including any additional or new requirements that become effective\\nafter the Effective Date which upon effectiveness shall be deemed to automatically amend this Policy to the extent\\nnecessary to comply with such additional or new requirements.\\nThe provisions in this Policy are intended to be applied to the fullest extent of the law. To the extent that any provision\\nof this Policy is found to be unenforceable or invalid under any applicable law, such provision will be applied to the\\nmaximum extent permitted and shall automatically be deemed amended in a manner consistent with its objectives to the\\nextent necessary to conform to applicable law. The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of this Policy shall not\\naffect the validity or enforceability of any other provision of this Policy. Recoupment of Erroneously Awarded Compensation\\nunder this Policy is not dependent upon the Company Group satisfying any conditions in this Policy, including any\\nrequirements to provide applicable documentation to the Nasdaq.\\nThe rights of the Company Group under this Policy to seek forfeiture or reimbursement are in addition to, and not in\\nlieu of, any rights of recoupment, or remedies or rights other than recoupment, that may be available to the Company\\nGroup pursuant to the terms of any law, government regulation or stock exchange listing requirement or any other policy,\\ncode of\\n4\\nconduct, employee handbook, employment agreement, equity award agreement, or other plan or agreement of the\\nCompany Group.\\n6. Amendment and Termination\\nTo the extent permitted by, and in a manner consistent with applicable law, including SEC and Nasdaq rules, the\\nCommittee may terminate, suspend or amend this Policy at any time in its discretion.\\n7. Successors\\nThis Policy shall be binding and enforceable against all persons and their respective beneficiaries, heirs, executors,\\nadministrators or other legal representatives with respect to any Covered Compensation granted, vested or paid to or\\nadministered by such persons or entities.\\n8. Agreement to Arbitrate; Governing Law; Venue\\nThis Policy and all rights and obligations hereunder will be governed by and interpreted in accordance with Texas law. \\nAny dispute arising from or relating to this Policy shall be subject to binding arbitration in accordance with the then-current\\nStreamlined Arbitration Rules of the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services (“JAMS”).

BUSINESS\\nOverview\\nUber Technologies, Inc. (“Uber,” “we,” “our,” or “us”) is a technology platform that uses a massive network, leading technology, operational excellence and\\nproduct expertise to power movement from point A to point B. We develop and operate proprietary technology applications supporting a variety of offerings on our\\nplatform (“platform(s)” or “Platform(s)”). We connect consumers (“Rider(s)”) with independent providers of ride services (“Mobility Driver(s)”) for ridesharing\\nservices, and connect Riders and other consumers (“Eater(s)”) with restaurants, grocers and other stores (collectively, “Merchants”) with delivery service providers\\n(“Couriers”) for meal preparation, grocery and other delivery services. Riders and Eaters are collectively referred to as “end-user(s)” or “consumer(s).” Mobility\\nDrivers and Couriers are collectively referred to as “Driver(s).” We also connect consumers with public transportation networks. We use this same network,\\ntechnology, operational excellence and product expertise to connect shippers (“Shipper(s)”) with carriers (“Carrier(s)”) in the freight industry by providing Carriers\\nwith the ability to book a shipment, transportation management and other logistics services. Uber is also developing technologies designed to provide new solutions\\nto everyday problems.\\nOur technology is available in approximately 70 countries around the world, principally in the United States (“U.S.”) and Canada, Latin America, Europe, the\\nMiddle East, Africa, and Asia (excluding China and Southeast Asia).\\nOur Segments\\nAs of December\\xa031, 2022, we had three operating and reportable segments: Mobility, Delivery and Freight. Mobility, Delivery and Freight platform offerings\\neach address large, fragmented markets.\\nMobility\\nOur Mobility offering connects consumers with a wide range of transportation modalities, such as ridesharing, carsharing, micromobility, rentals, public\\ntransit, taxis, and more—helping customers go almost anywhere they need. We believe our global leadership position—and the vast amount of marketplace data\\nthat comes along with it—means that we have the best technical and data platform to innovate faster than other companies with similar products.\\nWe believe our scale and global availability allows our Mobility segment to offer better consumer experiences to riders in a variety of vehicle types, providing\\nconsumers with higher reliability and Drivers with better earnings opportunities. Mobility also includes activity related to our financial partnerships products and\\nadvertising. We also participate in certain regions through our minority-owned affiliates.\\nDelivery\\nOur Delivery offering allows consumers to search for and discover the best of local commerce—from restaurants to grocery, alcohol, convenience and other\\nretailers—order a meal or other items, and either pick-up at the restaurant or have it delivered. We launched our Delivery app, Uber Eats, over seven years ago, and\\nthe business now includes the applications Postmates, Drizly and Cornershop across different markets. We believe our Delivery offering increases consumer\\nengagement with the Uber platform overall, which in turn results in broader reach for our Merchants who can attract Uber Eats consumers from Uber without\\nincreasing their own costs. For Drivers, we believe the Delivery offering leverages, and has expanded our earner base by increasing utilization and earnings across\\nthe network. We also believe it also attracts new Drivers to the platform who do not have access to Mobility-qualified vehicles. Over the last several years our\\nDelivery business has expanded to include Uber Direct, our white-label Delivery-as-a-Service offering to retailers and restaurants around the world, as well as\\nadvertising opportunities.\\nFreight\\nWe believe that Freight is revolutionizing the logistics industry. Freight powers a managed transportation and logistics network and connects Shippers and\\nCarriers in a digital marketplace to move shipments while leveraging our proprietary technology, brand awareness, and experience revolutionizing industries.\\nFreight provides an on-demand platform to automate and accelerate logistics transactions end-to-end while providing visibility and control of logistics networks.\\nFreight connects Carriers with Shippers’ shipments available on our platform, and gives Carriers upfront, transparent pricing and the ability to book a shipment\\nwith the touch of a button. Freight serves Shippers ranging from small- and medium-sized businesses to global enterprises. By leveraging logistics solutions\\nexpertise and value-add solutions, Freight enables Shippers to create and tender shipments, secure capacity on demand with real-time pricing, and track those\\nshipments from pickup to delivery. Freight operations are principally based in North America and Europe. We believe that all of these factors represent significant\\nefficiency improvements over traditional transportation management and freight brokerage providers.\\n4\\nPlatform Synergies\\nOur Platform\\nThe foundation of our platform is our massive network, leading technology, operational excellence, and product expertise. Together, these elements power\\nmovement from point A to point B.\\nMassive Network\\nOur massive, efficient, and intelligent network consists of tens of millions of Drivers, consumers, Merchants, Shippers and\\nCarriers, as well as underlying data, technology, and shared infrastructure. Our network becomes smarter with every trip. In\\napproximately 10,500 cities around the world (as of December 31, 2022), our network powers movement at the touch of a\\nbutton for millions, and we hope eventually billions, of people.\\nLeading Technology\\nWe have built proprietary marketplace, routing, and payments technologies. Marketplace technologies are the core of our deep\\ntechnology advantage and include demand prediction, matching and dispatching, and pricing technologies. Our technologies\\nmake it extremely efficient to launch new businesses and operationalize existing ones.\\nOperational Excellence\\nOur regional on-the-ground operations teams use their extensive market-specific knowledge to rapidly launch and scale\\nproducts in cities, support Drivers, consumers, Merchants, Shippers, and Carriers, and build and enhance relationships with\\ncities and regulators.\\nProduct Expertise\\nOur products are built with the expertise that allows us to set the standard for powering movement on-demand, provide\\nplatform users with a contextual, intuitive interface, continually evolve features and functionality, and deliver safety and trust.\\nWe intend to continue to invest in new platform offerings that we believe will further strengthen our platform and existing offerings.\\nWe believe that all of these synergies serve the customer experience, enabling us to attract new platform users and to deepen engagement with existing\\nplatform users. Both of these dynamics grow our network scale and liquidity, which further increases the value of our platform-to-platform users. For example,\\nDelivery attracts new consumers to our network—for the three months ended December\\xa031, 2022, over 61% of first-time Delivery consumers were new to our\\nplatform. Additionally, for the three months ended December\\xa0 31, 2022, consumers who used both Mobility and Delivery generated 10.9 Trips per month on\\naverage, compared to 4.6 Trips per month on average for consumers who used a single offering in cities where both Mobility and Delivery were offered. We\\nbelieve that these trends will improve as we further leverage the power of our platform.\\nWith our platform, we are making it even easier for our consumers to unlock convenience. In 2020, we rolled out our “Super App” view on iOS and Android,\\nwhich combines our multiple offerings into a single app and is designed to remove friction for our consumers. During November 2021, we launched Uber One in\\nthe United States as our single cross-platform membership program that brings together the best of Uber. Uber One members have access to discounts, special\\npricing, priority service, and exclusive perks across our rides, delivery and grocery offerings. Our Uber Pass and Eats Pass membership programs continue to\\nremain available in select cities as a subscription offering. Our membership programs are designed to make utilizing our suite of products a seamless and rewarding\\nexperience for our consumers. We exited 2022 with nearly 12 million members for our Uber One, Uber Pass, Eats Pass and Rides Pass membership programs.\\nWe are also utilizing our data and scale to offer marketplace-centric advertising to connect merchants and brands with our platform network and unlocking\\ncross-platform advertising formats. During October 2022, we officially launched Uber’s advertising division and introduced Uber Journey Ads, an engaging way\\nfor brands to connect with consumers throughout the entire ride process. We now offer a model that enables brands to partner with Uber on a variety of advertising\\noptions on the Uber and Uber Eats apps, and beyond, while connecting with consumers in brand-safe and captivating ways. We also provide comprehensive\\nreporting and analysis, which helps brands fine-tune their understanding of consumers and create more impactful campaigns as they connect with consumers at\\nrelevant points throughout their journeys and transactions. During the fourth quarter of 2022, active advertising merchants exceeded 315,000. We believe that our\\nadvertising further strengthens the power of our platform and will continue to do so as we onboard more advertisers.\\nCompetitive Environment\\nWe compete on a global basis in highly fragmented markets. We face significant competition in each of the mobility and delivery industries globally and in the\\nlogistics industry in the United States and Canada from existing, well-established, and low-cost alternatives, and in the future we expect to face competition from\\nnew market entrants given the low barriers to entry that characterize these industries. As we and our competitors introduce new products and offerings, and as\\nexisting products evolve, we expect to become subject to additional competition. While we work to expand globally and introduce new products and offerings\\nacross a range of industries, many of our competitors remain focused on a limited number of products or on a narrow geographic scope, allowing them to develop\\nspecialized expertise and employ resources in a more targeted manner than we do. The competition we face in each of our offerings includes:\\n5\\n•\\nMobility. Our Mobility offering competes with personal vehicle ownership and usage, which accounts for the majority of passenger miles in the markets\\nthat we serve, and traditional transportation services, including taxicab companies and taxi-hailing services, livery and other car services. In addition,\\npublic transportation can be a superior substitute to our Mobility offering and in many cases, offers a faster and lower-cost travel option in many cities. We\\nalso compete with other ridesharing companies, including certain of our minority-owned affiliates, for Drivers and Riders, including Lyft, Ola, Didi, Bolt,\\nand our Yandex.Taxi joint venture.\\n•\\nDelivery. Our Delivery offering competes with numerous companies in the meal, grocery and other delivery space in various regions for drivers,\\nconsumers, and merchants, including Amazon, Deliveroo, Delivery Hero, DoorDash, Gopuff, iFood, Instacart, Just Eat Takeaway, and Rappi. Our\\nDelivery offering also competes with restaurants, meal kit delivery services, grocery delivery services, and traditional grocers.\\n•\\nFreight. Our Freight offering competes with global and North American freight brokers such as C.H. Robinson, Total Quality Logistics, XPO Logistics,\\nConvoy, Echo Global Logistics, Coyote, Transfix, DHL, and NEXT Trucking.\\nGovernment Regulation\\nWe operate in a particularly complex legal and regulatory environment. Our business is subject to a variety of U.S. federal, state, local and foreign laws, rules,\\nand regulations, including those related to Internet activities, privacy, cybersecurity, data protection, intellectual property, competition, consumer protection,\\npayments, labor and employment, transportation services, transportation network companies, licensing regulations and taxation. These laws and regulations are\\nconstantly evolving and may be interpreted, applied, created, or amended, in a manner that could harm our business. Examples of certain laws and regulations we\\nare subject to are described below.\\nMobility\\nOur platform, and in particular our Mobility products, are subject to differing, and sometimes conflicting, laws, rules, and regulations in the numerous\\njurisdictions in which we operate. A large number of proposals are before various national, regional, and local legislative bodies and regulatory entities, both within\\nthe United States and in foreign jurisdictions, regarding issues related to our business model.\\nIn the United States, many state and local laws, rules, and regulations impose legal restrictions and other requirements on operating our Mobility products,\\nincluding licensing, insurance, screening, and background check requirements. Outside of the United States, certain jurisdictions have adopted similar laws, rules,\\nand regulations while other jurisdictions have not adopted any laws, rules, and regulations which govern our Mobility business. Further, certain jurisdictions,\\nincluding Argentina, Germany, Italy, Japan, South Korea, and Spain, six countries that we have identified as expansion markets, have adopted laws, rules, and\\nregulations banning certain ridesharing products or imposing extensive operational restrictions. This uncertainty and fragmented regulatory environment creates\\nsignificant complexities for our business and operating model.\\nSubstantially all states in the United States and numerous municipalities in the United States and around the world have adopted Transportation Network\\nCompany (“TNC”) regulations.\\xa0These regulations generally focus on companies that operate websites or mobile apps that connect individual drivers with their own\\nvehicles to passengers willing to pay to be driven to their destinations.\\xa0These regulations often require TNCs to comply with rules regarding, among other things,\\nbackground checks, vehicle inspections, accessible vehicles, driver and consumer safety, insurance, driver training, driver conduct, and other similar matters.\\nIn addition, many jurisdictions have adopted regulations that apply to how we classify the Drivers who use our platform. For example, California’s Assembly\\nBill 5 (“AB5”), which went into effect in January 2020, codified a test to determine whether a worker is an employee under California law. The California Attorney\\nGeneral, in conjunction with the city attorneys for San Francisco, Los Angeles and San Diego, filed a complaint under AB5, alleging that drivers are misclassified,\\nand sought an injunction and monetary damages related to the alleged competitive advantage caused by the alleged misclassification of drivers. Although the Court\\nissued a preliminary injunction enjoining Uber and Lyft from classifying drivers as independent contractors during the pendency of the lawsuit, the parties were\\ngranted a stipulation to dissolve the injunction in April 2021. In November 2020, California voters approved Proposition 22, a California state ballot initiative that\\nprovides a framework for drivers that use platforms like ours for independent work. Proposition 22 went into effect in December 2020 and as a result of the passage\\nof Proposition 22, Drivers are able to maintain their status as independent contractors under California law, and we and our competitors are required to comply with\\nthe provisions of Proposition 22. See the section titled “Risk Factors” included in Part I, Item 1A and “Note 14 – Commitments and Contingencies” to our\\nconsolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\\nIn addition, many jurisdictions have municipal bodies that adopted and will adopt regulations that govern our business. For example:\\n•\\nIn London, Transport for London (“TfL”) scrutinizes our business on an on-going basis and we are subject to license reviews at renewal. In November\\n2019, TfL declined to issue us a license, finding that we were not “fit and proper,” including with respect to confidence in our change and release\\nmanagement processes. We successfully appealed and since September 2020,\\n6\\nwe have been operating under a license in London. Our current TfL license, a 30 month operating license, was granted to us in May 2022.\\n•\\nSince April 2019, Mexico City’s Secretaría de Movilidad passed several amendments to existing ridesharing regulations implementing certain operational\\nrequirements, including a prohibition on the use of cash to pay for ridesharing services and, effective as of November 2019, a comprehensive TNC data\\nsharing requirement and a requirement that Drivers in Mexico City obtain additional licenses and annual vehicle inspections to provide ridesharing\\nservices. Except for the vehicle inspection, we obtained an injunction against such operational requirements which, if implemented without modification,\\ncould have a negative impact on our business and our failure to comply with such regulations may result in a potential revocation of our license to operate\\nin Mexico City.\\n•\\nIn addition, in August 2018, New York City approved regulations for the local for-hire market (which includes our ridesharing products), including a cap\\non the number of new vehicle licenses issued to drivers who offer for-hire services. In December 2018, New York City also established a standard for time\\nand distance designed to establish a minimum pay standard for drivers providing for-hire services in New York City, such as those provided by Drivers on\\nour platform. As another example, in October 2020, the Seattle City Council passed a minimum pay standard for drivers providing services on our\\nplatform that went into effect on January 1, 2021, and other jurisdictions have in the past considered or may consider regulations which would implement\\nminimum wage requirements or permit drivers to negotiate for minimum wages while providing services on our platform. Similar legislative or regulatory\\ninitiatives are being considered or have been enacted in countries outside the United States.\\nSee the section titled “Risk Factors” included in Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors”. This uncertainty and fragmented regulatory environment creates significant\\ncomplexities for our business and operating model.\\nAs we continue to expand our offerings, we may be subject to additional regulations separate from those that apply to our Mobility products.\\nData Privacy and Protection\\nOur technology platform, and the user data we collect and process to run our business, are an integral part of our business model and, as a result, our\\ncompliance with laws dealing with the collection and processing of personal data is core to our strategy to improve platform user experience and build trust.\\nRegulators around the world have adopted or proposed requirements regarding the collection, use, transfer, security, storage, destruction, and other processing of\\npersonal data, and these laws are increasing in number, enforcement, fines, and other penalties. Two examples of such regulations that have significant implications\\nfor our business are the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (the “GDPR”), a law which went into effect in May 2018 and implemented more\\nstringent requirements for processing personal data relating to individuals in the EU, and the California Consumer Privacy Act (the “CCPA”), which went into\\neffect in January 2020 and established new consumer rights and data privacy and protection requirements for covered businesses. U.S. state, city, federal, and\\nforeign regulators are expected to continue proposing and adopting significant laws impacting the processing of personally identifiable information and other data\\nrelating to individuals, such as the California Privacy Rights Act (“CPRA”) passed in California (effective in January 2023), and a draft data protection bill pending\\nin India.\\nPayments and Financial Services\\nMost jurisdictions in which we operate have laws that govern payment and financial services activities. For example, our subsidiary in the Netherlands, Uber\\nPayments B.V., is registered and authorized as an electronic money institution in support of certain payment activities in the European Economic Area (the “EEA”).\\nRegulators in certain additional jurisdictions may determine that certain aspects of our business are subject to these laws and could require us to obtain licenses to\\ncontinue to operate in such jurisdictions. In addition, laws related to money transmission and online payments are evolving, and changes in such laws could affect\\nour ability to provide payment processing on our platform. We are continuing to evaluate our options for seeking further licenses and approvals in several other\\njurisdictions to optimize payment solutions and support future growth of our business.\\nAntitrust\\nCompetition authorities closely scrutinize us under U.S. and foreign antitrust and competition laws. An increasing number of governments are enforcing\\ncompetition laws and are doing so with increased scrutiny, including governments in large markets such as the EU, the United States, Brazil, and India, particularly\\nsurrounding issues of pricing parity, price-fixing, and abuse of market power. In addition, governmental agencies and regulators may, among other things, prohibit\\nfuture acquisitions, divestitures, or combinations we plan to make, impose significant fines or penalties, require divestiture of certain of our assets, or impose other\\nrestrictions that limit or require us to modify our operations, including limitations on our contractual relationships with platform users or restrictions on our pricing\\nmodels.\\nIntellectual Property\\nWe believe that our intellectual property is essential to our business and affords us a competitive advantage in the markets in which we operate. Our intellectual\\nproperty includes the content of our website, mobile applications, registered domain names,\\n7\\nsoftware code, firmware, hardware and hardware designs, registered and unregistered trademarks, trademark applications, copyrights, trade secrets, inventions\\n(whether or not patentable), patents, and patent applications.\\nTo protect our intellectual property, we rely on a combination of copyright, trademark, patent, and trade secret laws, contractual provisions, end-user policies,\\nand disclosure restrictions. Upon discovery of potential infringement of our intellectual property, we assess and when necessary, take action to protect our rights as\\nappropriate. We also enter into confidentiality agreements and invention assignment agreements with our employees and consultants and seek to control access to,\\nand distribution of, our proprietary information in a commercially prudent manner.\\nResearch and Development\\nBecause the industries in which we compete are characterized by rapid technological advances, our ability to compete successfully depends heavily upon our\\nability to ensure a continual and timely flow of competitive new offerings and technologies. We continue to develop new technologies to enhance existing offerings\\nand services, and to expand the range of our offerings through research and development (“R&D”) and acquisition of third-party businesses and technology.\\nSeasonality\\nMobility\\nWe typically expect to experience seasonal impacts to our operating results as we generate higher Gross Bookings in our fourth quarter compared to other\\nquarters due in part to fourth-quarter holiday and business demand, and typically generate lower Gross Bookings in our third quarter compared to other quarters\\ndue in part to less usage of our platform during peak vacation season in North America and Europe. We have typically experienced quarter-over-quarter declines in\\nMobility in the first quarter. In 2022, we experienced altered seasonality as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and related restrictions. These primarily relate to\\nCOVID-19 variant outbreaks that drove lower Mobility volume and higher Delivery volume. We expect that seasonality will return to its historic patterns as\\nrecovery from the pandemic continues.\\nDelivery\\nWe typically expect to experience seasonal impacts to our operating results with increases in our Gross Bookings in the first and fourth quarters compared to\\nthe second and third quarters, although the historical growth of Delivery has masked these seasonal fluctuations. In 2022, we experienced altered seasonality as a\\nresult of the COVID-19 pandemic and related restrictions. These primarily relate to COVID-19 variant outbreaks that drove lower Mobility volume and higher\\nDelivery volume. We expect that seasonality will return to its historic patterns as recovery from the pandemic continues.\\nHuman Capital at Uber\\nEmployees\\nWe are a global company and as of December\\xa0 31, 2022, we and our subsidiaries had approximately 32,800 employees globally and operations in\\napproximately 70 countries and approximately 10,500 cities around the world. Our human capital strategies are developed and managed by our Chief People\\nOfficer, who reports to the CEO, and are overseen by the Compensation Committee and the Board of Directors.\\nOur success depends in large part on our ability to attract and retain high-quality management, operations, engineering, and other personnel who are in high\\ndemand, are often subject to competing employment offers, and are attractive recruiting targets for our competitors.\\nOur Board of Directors recognizes the strategic importance of these issues and the Compensation Committee has incorporated employee retention metrics into\\nthe compensation packages of our most senior executives.\\nAdapting to a New Way of Working. In 2022, more than two years after we asked employees who were able to do so work remotely in light of the COVID-19\\npandemic, we reopened our offices and welcomed our employees back to the office. The world of work has changed significantly in the last two years, and in\\nresponse we have evolved our work philosophy to reflect all that we have learned and what we believe will produce the best results for our employees and our\\nbusiness going forward. Our work model has shifted to a hybrid model where employees have flexibility to work from home.\\nEmployee Engagement. To attract and retain the best talent, we strive to establish a culture where people of all backgrounds can find a sense of belonging and\\nare able to achieve their highest capability. We measure how successful we have been in establishing the culture we need through employee engagement surveys\\nand related tools. We historically conducted a semi-annual workforce survey that measures employee engagement, overall satisfaction, and well-being. But in 2021,\\nwe made a shift toward continuous listening by collecting feedback from employees throughout the year and through various channels. We use the results of these\\nregular checks to better understand employees’ needs and support their teams on topics such as well-being, inclusivity, fairness, rewards and recognition, and\\ngrowth opportunities. For example, our hybrid return-to-office approach was shaped based on employee feedback. In addition to the engagement survey results, we\\nalso monitor the health of our workforce and the success of our people operations\\n8\\nthrough monitoring metrics such as attrition, retention, and offer acceptance rates, as well as sexual orientation, gender and ethnic diversity.\\nEmployee Development and Retention. We believe that employees who have opportunities for development are more engaged, satisfied, and productive.\\nEmployees are empowered to drive their own growth, whether by learning on the job, finding stretch assignments, participating in mentorship, or identifying their\\nnext opportunity within Uber through internal mobility programs. Employees have access to an internal jobs marketplace for full-time jobs as well as short-term\\nstretch assignments that enable them to have an impact on other areas of the business. Our goal is to help all employees be their best selves by providing programs\\nand resources that promote wellness and productivity. This helps our diverse employee base manage life’s expected and unexpected events. Globally, Uber offers\\ncompetitive benefits packages to our employees and their families. We provide competitive benefits as well as offerings tailored to our unique populations.\\nFor additional discussion, see the risk factor titled “—Our business depends on retaining and attracting high-quality personnel, and continued attrition, future\\nattrition, or unsuccessful succession planning could adversely affect our business.” included in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K as well as our\\n2022 People and Culture Report, which is available on our website. The information in the 2022 People and Culture report is not a part of this Form 10-K.\\nDiversity and Inclusion\\nWe believe that great minds don’t think alike, and we work hard to ensure that people of diverse backgrounds feel welcome and valued. We encourage\\ndifferent opinions and approaches to be heard, and then we come together and build. We believe that when employees feel empowered to succeed in a work\\nenvironment that celebrates, supports, and invests in diversity, progress follows. To achieve our objective to increase diversity in who we hire, we implement\\nprocesses throughout Uber and measure progress. For example, the Mansfield Rule was implemented by June 2021, to ensure that we have considered women,\\nLGBTQIA+ individuals, people with disabilities, and racially underrepresented talent by requiring that a certain percentage of candidates considered for leadership\\nroles come from historically underrepresented groups.\\nOur Board of Directors recognizes the strategic importance of these issues and incorporated employee diversity performance metrics into the compensation\\npackages of our most senior executives.\\nWe encourage employees who believe they, or any other employee, have been subjected to discrimination to notify their manager, Uber’s People Team or the\\nIntegrity Helpline.\\nAs a company that powers movement, it is our goal to ensure that everyone can move freely and safely, whether physically, economically, or socially. To do\\nthat, we strive to help fight the racism that persists across society, be a champion for equity, and create opportunities for all, both inside and outside our company.\\nIn July 2020, we announced commitments to becoming a more anti-racist company and since then, we have made progress on our commitment to build racial\\nequity internally and externally. For example, with the goal of ridding racism from our platform, we rolled out anti-racism and unconscious bias training for riders\\nand drivers in the United States and Brazil.\\nFor more information regarding our Diversity and Inclusion efforts, please see our 2022 People and Culture Report and our 2022 ESG Report, which are\\navailable on our website. The information in these reports is not a part of this Form 10-K.\\nDriver and Courier Well-Being\\nIn addition to employees discussed above, our business also depends on our ability to attract and engage Drivers, consumers, Merchants, Shippers, and\\nCouriers, as well as contractors and consultants that support our global operations.\\nIn relation to those individuals who earn income on our platform, Uber is one of the largest open platforms for work in the world, providing accessible, flexible\\nwork in approximately 70 countries. Drivers are key parts of the marketplaces that Uber has created through its apps. A diverse set of people choose to use our\\nplatform to earn income without having to apply for, or work the fixed schedules associated with, traditional employment. We believe this flexibility is an\\nimprovement over traditional work schedules and is something we believe can and should remain available to anyone who chooses platform-based work. Uber\\nmonitors regional and global driver attraction, retention and satisfaction rates.\\nAccessible, flexible, independent work has offered an option for many workers historically marginalized from the labor market and has enabled wide\\ngeographic coverage and reliable service offerings for consumers. However, it is increasingly clear that more can be done to improve the experience of using an\\napp to connect with work opportunities. Although the situation varies across countries and cities, the benefits and protections for independent workers are generally\\npatchy compared with those that employees receive. The current binary system of employment classification under some legal frameworks means that a worker is\\neither an employee who is provided significant social benefits or an independent worker who has access to relatively few. This does not have to be the case. At\\nUber, we believe that being your own boss should not have to come at the expense of security and dignity in work. Around the world, Uber has found innovative\\nways to address these issues.\\n•\\nAdvocacy: We have advocated for wider policy solutions to improve access to protections and benefits for independent workers. We believe all work\\nshould be treated equally. We also believe that legislative reform is needed to modernize the\\n9\\nsocial safety net. This includes requiring Uber—and other app based companies—to provide benefits and protections to their users without compromising\\nthe flexibility of their use of the app. Some recent examples of our advocacy to preserve flexibility of work while expanding access to benefits and\\nprotections are as follows:\\n◦\\nIn Washington State, we welcomed a new law that preserves rideshare driver independence and confers new benefits such as minimum earnings\\nguarantee, injury protection and paid sick leave.\\n◦\\nIn Chile, the legislature passed a law that incorporates platform workers into the government’s healthcare and pensions scheme and introduces\\nnew requirements for platform companies such as minimum earnings guarantee for time spent actively working, maintain on-app insurance\\ncoverage, and provide couriers with safety equipment.\\n•\\nProtections and benefits: We partner with leading insurance companies around the world to pioneer protections for independent workers.\\n•\\nEarnings: We are continually developing new technology that Drivers can use to acquire information that may help them save on costs and make\\ninformed choices about where and when to drive (based on when and where their earnings potential is highest).\\n•\\nLearning and Growth: We have partnered with learning and academic institutions to provide opportunities to eligible Drivers and their family members\\nthrough undergraduate degree programs and courses on entrepreneurship, skills development and language learning. For example, since its launch in 2018,\\nour partnership with Arizona State University has enrolled nearly 5,000 Drivers and their family members in undergraduate degree programs online.\\n•\\nEngagement: We are focused on listening to and responding to the ideas and concerns of Drivers and Merchants who use our platform. We believe that\\nthe best ideas can come from anywhere, both inside and outside our company. In locations around the world, we are piloting innovative ways for Drivers\\nto participate in meaningful dialogue with us. In markets across the world, we hold regular meetings with Driver associations and conduct regular surveys\\nto gather feedback on our app, our support services, and other matters.\\nFor additional discussion, see the risk factor titled “—If we are unable to attract or maintain a critical mass of Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and\\ncarriers, whether as a result of competition or other factors, our platform will become less appealing to platform users, and our financial results would be adversely\\nimpacted.” included in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K as well our 2022 ESG Report and our 2022 People and Culture Report.

RISK FACTORS\\nCertain factors may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. You should carefully consider the following\\nrisks, together with all of the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the sections titled “Special Note Regarding Forward-\\nLooking Statements” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and our financial statements and the related\\nnotes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Any of the following risks could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition,\\noperating results, or prospects and could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline, which would cause you to lose all or part of your investment. Our\\nbusiness, financial condition, operating results, or prospects could also be harmed by risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently do not\\nbelieve are material.\\nRisk Factor Summary\\n10\\nThe following are some of these risks, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition, operating results, or prospects.\\n•\\nOur business would be adversely affected if Drivers were classified as employees, workers or quasi-employees instead of independent contractors.\\n•\\nThe mobility, delivery, and logistics industries are highly competitive, with well-established and low-cost alternatives that have been available for decades,\\nlow barriers to entry, low switching costs, and well-capitalized competitors in nearly every major geographic region.\\n•\\nTo remain competitive in certain markets, we have in the past lowered, and may continue to lower, fares or service fees, and we have in the past offered,\\nand may continue to offer, significant Driver incentives and consumer discounts and promotions.\\n•\\nWe have incurred significant losses since inception, including in the United States and other major markets. We expect our operating expenses to increase\\nsignificantly in the foreseeable future, and we may not achieve or maintain profitability.\\n•\\nIf we are unable to attract or maintain a critical mass of Drivers, consumers, merchants, Shippers, and Carriers, whether as a result of competition or other\\nfactors, our platform will become less appealing to platform users.\\n•\\nOur business depends on retaining and attracting high-quality personnel, and continued attrition, future attrition, or unsuccessful succession planning\\ncould adversely affect our business.\\n•\\nMaintaining and enhancing our brand and reputation is critical to our business prospects. We receive significant media coverage, including negative\\npublicity regarding our brand and reputation, and while we have taken significant steps to rehabilitate our brand and reputation, failure to maintain and\\nenhance our brand and reputation will cause our business to suffer.\\n•\\nOur historical workplace culture and forward-leaning approach created operational, compliance, and cultural challenges and our efforts to address these\\nchallenges may not be successful.\\n•\\nIf we are unable to optimize our organizational structure or effectively manage our growth, our financial performance and future prospects will be\\nadversely affected.\\n•\\nPlatform users may engage in, or be subject to, criminal, violent, inappropriate, or dangerous activity that results in major safety incidents, which may\\nharm our ability to attract and retain Drivers, consumers, merchants, Shippers, and Carriers.\\n•\\nWe are making substantial investments in new offerings and technologies, and may increase such investments in the future. These new ventures are\\ninherently risky, and we may never realize any expected benefits from them.\\n•\\nWe generate a significant percentage of our Gross Bookings from trips in large metropolitan areas, and these operations may be negatively affected by\\neconomic, social, weather, and regulatory conditions, public health concerns or other circumstances.\\n•\\nWe may fail to offer autonomous vehicle technologies on our platform, fail to offer such technologies on our platform before our competitors, or such\\ntechnologies may fail to perform as expected, may be inferior to those offered by our competitors, or may be perceived as less safe than those offered by\\ncompetitors or non-autonomous vehicles.\\n•\\nWe have experienced and may experience security or data privacy breaches or other unauthorized or improper access to, use of, alteration of or destruction\\nof our proprietary or confidential data, employee data, or platform user data.\\n•\\nCyberattacks, including computer malware, ransomware, viruses, denial of service attacks, spamming, and phishing attacks could harm our reputation,\\nbusiness, and operating results.\\n•\\nWe are subject to climate change risks, including physical and transitional risks, and if we are unable to manage such risks, our business may be adversely\\nimpacted.\\n•\\nWe have made climate related commitments that require us to invest significant effort, resources, and management time and circumstances may arise,\\nincluding those beyond our control, that may require us to revise the contemplated timeframes for implementing these commitments.\\n•\\nOutbreaks of contagious disease, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and the impact of actions to mitigate such pandemic, have adversely affected, and\\nfuture outbreaks of disease may adversely affect, parts of our business.\\n•\\nWe rely on third parties maintaining open marketplaces to distribute our platform and to provide the software we use in certain of our products and\\nofferings. If such third parties interfere with the distribution of our products or offerings or with our use of such software, our business would be adversely\\naffected.\\n•\\nWe will require additional capital to support the growth of our business, and this capital might not be available on reasonable terms or at all.\\n11\\n•\\nIf we are unable to successfully identify, acquire and integrate suitable businesses, our operating results and prospects could be harmed, and any\\nbusinesses we acquire may not perform as expected or be effectively integrated.\\n•\\nWe may continue to be blocked from or limited in providing or operating our products and offerings in certain jurisdictions, and may be required to\\nmodify our business model in those jurisdictions as a result.\\n•\\nOur business is subject to numerous legal and regulatory risks that could have an adverse impact on our business and future prospects.\\n•\\nOur business is subject to extensive government regulation and oversight relating to the provision of payment and financial services.\\n•\\nWe face risks related to our collection, use, transfer, disclosure, and other processing of data, which have resulted and may result in investigations,\\ninquiries, litigation, fines, legislative and regulatory action, and negative press about our privacy and data protection practices.\\n•\\nIf we are unable to protect our intellectual property, or if third parties are successful in claiming that we are misappropriating the intellectual property of\\nothers, we may incur significant expense and our business may be adversely affected.\\n•\\nThe market price of our common stock has been, and may continue to be, volatile or may decline steeply or suddenly regardless of our operating\\nperformance, and we may not be able to meet investor or analyst expectations. You may not be able to resell your shares at or above the price you paid and\\nmay lose all or part of your investment.\\nOperational and Economic Risks Related to Our Business\\nOperational Risks\\nOur business would be adversely affected if Drivers were classified as employees, workers or quasi-employees.\\nThe classification of Drivers is currently being challenged in courts, by legislators and by government agencies in the United States and abroad. We are\\ninvolved in numerous legal proceedings globally, including putative class and collective class action lawsuits, demands for arbitration, charges and claims before\\nadministrative agencies, and investigations or audits by labor, social security, and tax authorities that claim that Drivers should be treated as our employees (or as\\nworkers or quasi-employees where those statuses exist), rather than as independent contractors. We believe that Drivers are independent contractors because,\\namong other things, they can choose whether, when, and where to provide services on our platform, are free to provide services on our competitors’ platforms, and\\nprovide a vehicle to perform services on our platform. Nevertheless, we may not be successful in defending the classification of Drivers in some or all jurisdictions.\\nFurthermore, the costs associated with defending, settling, or resolving pending and future lawsuits (including demands for arbitration) relating to the classification\\nof Drivers have been and may continue to be material to our business.\\nIn addition, more than 150,000 Drivers in the United States who have entered into arbitration agreements with us have filed (or expressed an intention to file)\\narbitration demands against us that assert similar classification claims. We have resolved the classification claims of a majority of these Drivers under individual\\nsettlement agreements, pursuant to which we have paid approximately $521 million as of December\\xa031, 2022. Furthermore, we are involved in numerous legal\\nproceedings regarding the enforceability of arbitration agreements entered into with Drivers. If we are not successful in such proceedings, this could negatively\\nimpact the enforceability of arbitration agreements in other legal proceedings, which could have an adverse consequence on our business and financial condition.\\nChanges to foreign, state, and local laws governing the definition or classification of independent contractors, or judicial decisions regarding independent\\ncontractor classification, could require classification of Drivers as employees (or workers or quasi-employees where those statuses exist) and/or representation of\\nDrivers by labor unions. For example, California’s Assembly Bill 5 became effective as of January 1, 2020. Government authorities and private plaintiffs have\\nbrought litigation asserting that Assembly Bill 5 requires Drivers in California to be classified as employees.\\nIn November 2020, California voters approved Proposition 22, a California state ballot initiative that provides a framework for drivers that use platforms like\\nours for independent work. Proposition 22 went into effect in December 2020 and we expect that Drivers will be able to maintain their status as independent\\ncontractors under California law and that we and our competitors will be required to comply with the provisions of Proposition 22. Although our stipulation to\\ndissolve the California Attorney General’s preliminary injunction was granted in April 2021, that litigation remains pending, and we also may face liability relating\\nto periods before the effective date of Proposition 22. Legal challenges, including constitutional challenges, to Proposition 22 have been and may continue to be\\nfiled.\\nWe face similar challenges in other jurisdictions within the United States and abroad. For example, in July 2020, the Massachusetts Attorney General filed a\\ncomplaint against Uber and Lyft, alleging that drivers are misclassified, and seeking an injunction. If we do not prevail in current litigation or similar actions that\\nmay be brought in the future, we may be required to treat Drivers as employees and/or make other changes to our business model in certain jurisdictions. If, as a\\nresult of legislation or judicial decisions, we are required to classify Drivers as employees, we would incur significant additional expenses for compensating\\nDrivers,\\n12\\nincluding expenses associated with the application of wage and hour laws (including minimum wage, overtime, and meal and rest period requirements), employee\\nbenefits, social security contributions, taxes (direct and indirect), and potential penalties. In this case, we anticipate significant price increases for Riders to offset\\nthese additional costs; however, we believe that the financial impact to Uber would be moderated by the likelihood of other industry participants being similarly\\naffected. Additionally, we may not have adequate Driver supply as Drivers may opt out of our platform given the loss of flexibility under an employment model,\\nand we may not be able to hire a majority of the Drivers currently using our platform. Further, any such reclassification would require us to fundamentally change\\nour business model, and consequently have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\\nOther examples of judicial decisions include a decision by the French Supreme Court that a driver for a third-party meal delivery service was under a\\n“subordinate relationship” of the service, indicating an employment relationship, a decision by the French Supreme Court that reclassified an UberX Driver as an\\nemployee (which has been followed by inconsistent appellate decisions regarding employee status), decisions by several Swiss governmental bodies ruling that\\nDrivers should be classified as employees for Swiss social security or regulatory purposes, a recent Spanish regulation of food delivery platforms that presumes\\nemployment status and a ruling in September 2021 by a Netherlands court that Mobility Drivers are employees within the meaning of the taxi collective bargaining\\nagreement.\\nIn addition, reclassification of Drivers as employees, workers or quasi-employees where those statuses exist, have and could lead to groups of Drivers\\nbecoming represented by labor unions and similar organizations. For example, in May 2021, we formally recognized a UK driver union. If a significant number of\\nDrivers were to become unionized and collective bargaining agreement terms were to deviate significantly from our business model, our business, financial\\ncondition, operating results and cash flows could be materially adversely affected. In addition, a labor dispute involving Drivers may harm our reputation, disrupt\\nour operations and reduce our net revenues, and the resolution of labor disputes may increase our costs.\\nIn addition, if we are required to classify Drivers as employees, workers or quasi-employees, this may impact our current financial statement presentation\\nincluding revenue, cost of revenue, incentives and promotions as further described in our significant and critical accounting policies in the section titled “Critical\\nAccounting Estimates” included in Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and Note 1 in the section titled “Notes to the Consolidated Financial\\nStatements” included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\\nThe mobility, delivery, and logistics industries are highly competitive, with well-established and low-cost alternatives that have been available for decades, low\\nbarriers to entry, low switching costs, and well-capitalized competitors in nearly every major geographic region. If we are unable to compete effectively in these\\nindustries, our business and financial prospects would be adversely impacted.\\nOur platform provides offerings in the mobility, delivery, and logistics industries. We compete on a global basis, and the markets in which we compete are\\nhighly fragmented. We face significant competition in each of the mobility and delivery industries globally and in the logistics industry in the United States and\\nCanada from existing, well-established, and low-cost alternatives, and in the future we expect to face competition from new market entrants given the low barriers\\nto entry that characterize these industries. In addition, within each of these markets, the cost to switch between products is low. Consumers have a propensity to\\nshift to the lowest-cost or highest-quality provider; Drivers have a propensity to shift to the platform with the highest earnings potential; restaurants and other\\nmerchants have a propensity to shift to the delivery platform that offers the lowest service fee for their meals and other goods and provides the highest volume of\\norders; and Shippers and Carriers have a propensity to shift to the platform with the best price and most convenient service for hauling shipments.\\nFurther, while we work to expand globally and introduce new products and offerings across a range of industries, many of our competitors remain focused on a\\nlimited number of products or on a narrow geographic scope, allowing them to develop specialized expertise and employ resources in a more targeted manner than\\nwe do. As we and our competitors introduce new products and offerings, and as existing products evolve, we expect to become subject to additional competition. In\\naddition, our competitors may adopt certain of our product features, or may adopt innovations that Drivers, consumers, merchants, Shippers, and Carriers value\\nmore highly than ours, which would render our products less attractive or reduce our ability to differentiate our products. Increased competition could result in,\\namong other things, a reduction of the revenue we generate from the use of our platform, the number of platform users, the frequency of use of our platform, and\\nour margins.\\nWe face competition in each of our offerings, including:\\n•\\nMobility. Our Mobility offering competes with personal vehicle ownership and usage, which accounts for the majority of passenger miles in the\\nmarkets that we serve, and traditional transportation services, including taxicab companies and taxi-hailing services, livery and other car services. In\\naddition, public transportation can be a superior substitute to our Mobility offering and in many cases, offers a faster and lower-cost travel option in\\nmany cities. We also compete with other ridesharing companies, including certain of our minority-owned affiliates, for Drivers and riders, including\\nLyft, Ola, Didi, Grab, Bolt, and our Yandex.Taxi joint venture.\\n•\\nDelivery. Our Delivery offering competes with numerous companies in the meal, grocery and other delivery space in\\n13\\nvarious regions for Drivers, consumers, and merchants, including DoorDash, Deliveroo, Glovo, Instacart, Gopuff, Rappi, iFood, Delivery Hero, Just\\nEat Takeaway, and Amazon. Our Delivery offering also competes with restaurants, including those that offer their own delivery and/or take-away, meal\\nkit delivery services, grocery delivery services, and traditional grocers.\\n•\\nFreight. Our Freight offering competes with global and North American freight brokers and managed transportation providers such as C.H. Robinson,\\nTotal Quality Logistics, XPO Logistics, Convoy, Echo Global Logistics, Coyote, Transfix, DHL, and NEXT Trucking.\\nMany of our competitors are well-capitalized and offer discounted services, Driver incentives, consumer discounts and promotions, innovative products and\\nofferings, and alternative pricing models, which may be more attractive to consumers than those that we offer. Further, some of our current or potential competitors\\nhave, and may in the future continue to have, greater resources and access to larger Driver, consumer, merchant, Shipper, or Carrier bases in a particular geographic\\nmarket. In addition, our competitors in certain geographic markets enjoy substantial competitive advantages such as greater brand recognition, longer operating\\nhistories, larger marketing budgets, better localized knowledge, and more supportive regulatory regimes. As a result, such competitors may be able to respond more\\nquickly and effectively than us in such markets to new or changing opportunities, technologies, consumer preferences, regulations, or standards, which may render\\nour products or offerings less attractive. In addition, future competitors may share in the effective benefit of any regulatory or governmental approvals and litigation\\nvictories we may achieve, without having to incur the costs we have incurred to obtain such benefits.\\nAs a result of certain divestitures, we are contractually restricted from competing with our minority-owned affiliates with respect to certain aspects of our\\nbusiness, including in China through August 2023, Russia/CIS through February 2025, Southeast Asia through the later of March 2023 or one year after we dispose\\nof all interests in Grab, and the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and certain parts of Europe with respect to e-bikes and e-scooters through May\\n2023, while none of our minority-owned affiliates are restricted from competing with us anywhere in the world. Didi currently competes with us in certain\\ncountries in Latin America and in Australia. In addition, our Yandex.Taxi joint venture currently competes with us in certain countries in Europe and Africa. As\\nDidi and our other minority-owned affiliates continue to expand their businesses, they may in the future compete with us in additional geographic markets. In\\naddition, we are contractually restricted from competing with some of our majority-owned affiliates with respect to certain aspects of our business, including\\ncompeting against Uber Freight with respect to freight brokerage.\\nAdditionally, if we are unable to obtain regulatory approval of our acquisitions, we may not ultimately consummate such acquisitions or may consummate\\nthem only in jurisdictions where antitrust approval is obtained. Further, in order to obtain regulatory approval of acquisitions, we may be required to divest all or\\npart of our or the target company’s operations or agree to other remedies. Any such remedies could result in additional competition in some or all markets.\\nFor all of these reasons, we may not be able to compete successfully against our current and future competitors. Our inability to compete effectively would\\nhave an adverse effect on, or otherwise harm, our business, financial condition, and operating results.\\nTo remain competitive in certain markets, we have in the past lowered, and may continue to lower, fares or service fees, and we have in the past offered, and\\nmay continue to offer, significant Driver incentives and consumer discounts and promotions, which has adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect\\nour financial performance.\\nTo remain competitive in certain markets and generate network scale and liquidity, we have in the past lowered, and may continue to lower, fares or service\\nfees, and we have offered and may continue to offer significant Driver incentives and consumer discounts and promotions. At times, in certain geographic markets,\\nwe have offered, and may continue to offer, Driver incentives that cause the total amount of the fare that a Driver retains, combined with the Driver incentives a\\nDriver receives from us, to increase, at times meeting or exceeding the amount of Gross Bookings we generate for a given Trip. In certain geographic markets and\\nregions, we do not have a leading category position, which may result in us choosing to further increase the amount of Driver incentives and consumer discounts\\nand promotions that we offer in those geographic markets and regions. We cannot assure you that offering such Driver incentives and consumer discounts and\\npromotions will be successful. Driver incentives, consumer discounts, promotions, and reductions in fares and our service fee have negatively affected, and will\\ncontinue to negatively affect, our financial performance. Additionally, we rely on pricing models to calculate consumer fares and Driver earnings, which have been\\nmodified over time and will likely in the future be modified, and pricing models at times vary based upon jurisdiction. We cannot assure you that our pricing\\nmodels or strategies will be successful in attracting consumers and Drivers. For example, changes we have made in California to the information that Drivers see in\\nthe application, as well as pricing and offer structure changes, adversely impacted usage of the application. If we are unable to successfully manage these and\\nsimilar kinds of changes in the future, our business may be adversely impacted.\\nThe markets in which we compete have attracted significant investments from a wide range of funding sources, and we anticipate that many of our competitors\\nwill continue to be highly capitalized. Moreover, certain of our stockholders have made substantial investments in certain of our competitors and may increase such\\ninvestments, make new investments in other competitors, or enter into strategic transactions with competitors in the future. These investments or strategic\\ntransactions, along with other competitive advantages discussed above, may allow our competitors to compete more effectively against us and continue to lower\\ntheir prices, offer Driver incentives or consumer discounts and promotions, or otherwise attract Drivers, consumers, merchants, Shippers, and\\n14\\nCarriers to their platform and away from ours. Such competitive pressures may lead us to maintain or lower fares or service fees or maintain or increase our Driver\\nincentives and consumer discounts and promotions. Ridesharing and certain other categories in which we compete are relatively nascent, and we cannot guarantee\\nthat they will stabilize at a competitive equilibrium that will allow us to achieve profitability.\\nWe have incurred significant losses since inception, including in the United States and other major markets. We expect our operating expenses to increase\\nsignificantly in the foreseeable future, and we may not achieve or maintain profitability.\\nWe have incurred significant losses since inception. We incurred operating losses of $4.9 billion, $3.8 billion and $1.8 billion in the years ended December 31,\\n2020, 2021 and 2022, and as of December\\xa031, 2022, we had an accumulated deficit of $32.8 billion. We will need to generate and sustain increased revenue levels\\nand decrease proportionate expenses in future periods to achieve profitability in many of our largest markets, including in the United States, and even if we do, we\\nmay not be able to maintain or increase profitability. We may continue to incur losses in the near term as a result of substantial increases in our operating expenses,\\nas we continue to invest in order to: increase the number of Drivers, consumers, merchants, Shippers, and Carriers using our platform through incentives, discounts,\\nand promotions; expand within existing or into new markets; increase our research and development expenses; expand marketing channels and operations; hire\\nadditional employees; and add new products and offerings to our platform. These efforts may prove more expensive than we anticipate, and we may not succeed in\\nincreasing our revenue sufficiently to offset these expenses. Many of our efforts to generate revenue are new and unproven, and any failure to adequately increase\\nrevenue or contain the related costs could prevent us from attaining or increasing profitability. In addition, we sometimes introduce new products that we expect to\\nadd value to our overall platform and network but which we expect will generate lower Gross Bookings per Trip or a lower Take Rate. Further, we charge a lower\\nservice fee to certain of our largest chain restaurant partners on our Delivery offering to grow the number of Delivery consumers, which may at times result in a\\nnegative take rate with respect to those transactions after considering amounts collected from consumers and paid to Drivers. As we expand our offerings to\\nadditional cities, our offerings in these cities may be less profitable than the markets in which we currently operate. As such, we may not be able to achieve or\\nmaintain profitability in the near term, in accordance with our expectations, or at all. Additionally, we may not realize the operating efficiencies we expect to\\nachieve as a result of our acquisition of Careem, Postmates or other acquired companies, and may continue to incur significant operating losses in the United\\nStates, Middle East, North Africa, and Pakistan in the future. Even if we do experience operating efficiencies, our operating results may not improve, at least in the\\nnear term.\\nIf we are unable to attract or maintain a sufficient number of Drivers, consumers, merchants, Shippers, and Carriers, whether as a result of competition or\\nother factors, our platform will become less appealing to platform users, and our financial results would be adversely impacted.\\nOur success in a given geographic market significantly depends on our ability to develop our network scale and liquidity in that geographic market by\\nattracting Drivers, consumers, merchants, Shippers, and Carriers to our platform. If Drivers choose not to offer their services through our platform, we may lack a\\nsufficient supply of Drivers to attract consumers and merchants to our platform. We have experienced and expect to continue to experience Driver supply\\nconstraints in most geographic markets in which we operate. To the extent that we experience Driver supply constraints in a given market, we may need to increase\\nor may not be able to reduce the Driver incentives that we offer without adversely affecting the supply liquidity that we experience in that market. Similarly, if\\nCarriers choose not to offer their services through our platform or elect to use other freight brokers, we may lack a sufficient supply of Carriers in specific\\ngeographic markets to attract Shippers to our platform. Furthermore, if merchants choose to partner with other delivery services in a specific geographic market, or\\nif merchants choose to engage exclusively with our competitors, other merchant marketing websites, or other delivery services, we may lack a sufficient variety and\\nsupply of restaurant and other merchant options, or lack access to the most popular restaurants, such that our Delivery offering will become less appealing to\\nconsumers and merchants. A significant amount of our Delivery Gross Bookings come from a limited number of large restaurant groups and other merchants, and\\nthis concentration increases the risk of fluctuations in our operating results and our sensitivity to any material adverse developments experienced by our significant\\nrestaurant partners. If platform users choose to use other ridesharing, meal delivery, or logistics services, we may lack sufficient opportunities for Drivers to earn a\\nfare, Carriers to book a shipment, or restaurants to provide a meal, which may reduce the perceived utility of our platform. An insufficient supply of platform users\\nwould decrease our network liquidity and adversely affect our revenue and financial results. Although we may benefit from having larger scale and liquidity than\\nsome competitors, those network effects may not result in competitive advantages or may be overcome by smaller competitors. Maintaining a balance between\\nsupply and demand in any given area at any given time and our ability to execute operationally may be more important to service quality than the absolute size of\\nthe network. If our service quality diminishes or our competitors’ products achieve greater market adoption, our competitors may be able to grow at a quicker rate\\nthan we do and may diminish our network effect.\\nOur number of platform users may decline materially or fluctuate as a result of many factors, including, among other things, dissatisfaction with the operation\\nof our platform, the price of fares, meals, and shipments (including a reduction in incentives), dissatisfaction with the quality of service provided by the Drivers and\\nmerchants on our platform, quality of platform user support, dissatisfaction with the merchant selection on Delivery, negative publicity related to our brand,\\nincluding as a result of safety incidents and corporate reporting related to safety, perceived political or geopolitical affiliations, a pandemic or an outbreak of\\ndisease or similar public health concern, or fear of such an event, treatment of Drivers, perception that our culture has not fundamentally changed,\\n15\\ndissatisfaction with changes we make to our products and offerings, or dissatisfaction with our products and offerings in general. In addition, if we are unable to\\nprovide high-quality support to platform users or respond to reported incidents, including safety incidents, in a timely and acceptable manner, our ability to attract\\nand retain platform users could be adversely affected. If Drivers, consumers, merchants, Shippers, and Carriers do not establish or maintain active accounts with us,\\nif a social media or other campaign encouraging users to cease use of our platform takes hold, if we fail to provide high-quality support, or if we cannot otherwise\\nattract and retain a large number of Drivers, consumers, merchants, Shippers, and Carriers, our revenue would decline, and our business would suffer.\\nThe number of Drivers and merchants on our platform could decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including Drivers ceasing to provide their\\nservices through our platform, passage or enforcement of local laws limiting our products and offerings, the low switching costs between competitor platforms or\\nservices, and dissatisfaction with our brand or reputation, pricing models (including potential reductions in incentives), ability to prevent safety incidents, or other\\naspects of our business. While we aim to provide an earnings opportunity comparable to that available in retail, wholesale, or merchant services or other similar\\nwork, we continue to experience dissatisfaction with our platform from a significant number of Drivers. In particular, as we aim to reduce Driver incentives to\\nimprove our financial performance, we expect Driver dissatisfaction will generally increase.\\nOften, we are forced to make tradeoffs between the satisfaction of various platform users, as a change that one category of users views as positive will likely be\\nviewed as negative to another category of users. We also take certain measures to protect against fraud, help increase safety, and prevent privacy and security\\nbreaches, including terminating access to our platform for users with low ratings or reported incidents, and imposing certain qualifications for Drivers and\\nmerchants, which may damage our relationships with platform users or discourage or diminish their use of our platform. Further, we are investing in our\\nautonomous vehicle strategy, which may add to Driver dissatisfaction over time, as it may reduce the need for Drivers. Driver dissatisfaction has in the past resulted\\nin protests by Drivers in various regions, including India, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Such protests have resulted, and any future protests may\\nresult, in interruptions to our business. Continued Driver dissatisfaction may also result in a decline in our number of platform users, which would reduce our\\nnetwork liquidity, and which in turn may cause a further decline in platform usage. Any decline in the number of Drivers, consumers, merchants, Shippers, or\\nCarriers using our platform would reduce the value of our network and would harm our future operating results.\\nIn addition, changes in Driver qualification and background-check requirements may increase our costs and reduce our ability to onboard additional Drivers to\\nour platform. Our Driver qualification and background check process varies by jurisdiction, and there have been allegations, including from regulators, legislators,\\nprosecutors, taxicab owners, and consumers, that our background check process is insufficient or inadequate. With respect to Drivers who are only eligible to make\\ndeliveries through Delivery, our qualification and background check standards are generally less extensive than the standards for Drivers who are eligible to\\nprovide rides through our Mobility products. Legislators and regulators may pass laws or adopt regulations in the future requiring Drivers to undergo a materially\\ndifferent type of qualification, screening, or background check process, or that limit our ability to access information used in the background check process in an\\nefficient manner, which could be costly and time-consuming. Required changes in the qualification, screening, and background check process (including any\\nchanges to such processes of Careem, Postmates or other acquired companies) could also reduce the number of Drivers in those markets or extend the time required\\nto recruit new Drivers to our platform, which would adversely impact our business and growth. Furthermore, we rely on a single background-check provider in\\ncertain jurisdictions, and we may not be able to arrange for adequate background checks from a different provider on commercially reasonable terms or at all. The\\nfailure of this provider to provide background checks on a timely basis would result in our inability to onboard new Drivers or retain existing Drivers undergoing\\nperiodic background checks that are required to continue using our platform.\\nMaintaining and enhancing our brand and reputation is critical to our business prospects. We receive significant media coverage, including negative publicity\\nregarding our brand and reputation, and while we have taken significant steps to rehabilitate our brand and reputation, failure to maintain or enhance our\\nbrand and reputation will cause our business to suffer.\\nMaintaining and enhancing our brand and reputation is critical to our ability to attract new employees and platform users, to preserve and deepen the\\nengagement of our existing employees and platform users, and to mitigate legislative or regulatory scrutiny, litigation, government investigations, and adverse\\nplatform user sentiment.\\nWe receive a high degree of negative media coverage around the world, which adversely affects our brand and reputation and fuels distrust of our company.\\nNegative publicity, particularly related to the period prior to and through 2017, adversely affects our brand and reputation, makes it difficult for us to attract and\\nretain platform users, reduces confidence in and use of our products and offerings, invites continued legislative and regulatory scrutiny, and results in additional\\nlitigation and governmental investigations. As a result, our competitors raised additional capital, increased their investments in certain markets, and improved their\\ncategory positions and market shares, and may continue to do so.\\nWe recently released a second safety report, which provides the public with data related to reports of sexual assaults and other critical safety incidents claimed\\nto have occurred on our platform in the United States. Public responses to our safety reports or any future safety reports or similar public reporting of safety\\nincidents claimed to have occurred on our platform, which may include disclosure of reports provided to regulators and other government authorities, as well as\\npublic responses to any third party\\n16\\nassessments of our civil rights impact, may continue to result in positive and negative media coverage and increased regulatory scrutiny and could adversely affect\\nour reputation with platform users. Further unfavorable media coverage and negative publicity could adversely impact our financial results and future prospects. As\\nour platform continues to scale and becomes increasingly interconnected, resulting in increased media coverage and public awareness of our brand, future damage\\nto our brand and reputation could have an amplified effect on our various platform offerings. Additionally, some of our acquired and majority-owned companies,\\nincluding Careem, Postmates and Cornershop, have or will continue to use their own brands and/or operate their own apps in parallel with our brand and apps, and\\nany damage or reputational harm to their brands could adversely impact our brand and reputation.\\nOur brand and reputation might also be harmed by events outside of our control. For example, we have licensed our brand in connection with certain\\ndivestitures and joint ventures, including to Didi in China and to our Yandex.Taxi joint venture in Russia/CIS, and while we have certain contractual protections in\\nplace governing the use of our brand by these companies, we do not control these businesses, we are not able to anticipate their actions, and consumers may not be\\naware that these service providers are not controlled by us. Additionally, in light of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, we announced that we are actively\\nlooking for opportunities to accelerate the sale of our remaining holdings in our Yandex.Taxi joint venture. Furthermore, if Drivers, merchants, or Carriers provide\\ndiminished quality of service, are involved in incidents regarding safety or privacy, engage in malfeasance, or otherwise violate the law, we may receive\\nunfavorable press coverage and our reputation and business may be harmed. As a result, any of these third parties could take actions that result in harm to our\\nbrand, reputation, and consequently, our business.\\nWhile we have taken significant steps to rehabilitate our brand and reputation, the successful rehabilitation of our brand will depend largely on maintaining a\\ngood reputation, minimizing the number of safety incidents, continuing an improved culture and workplace practices, improving our compliance programs,\\nmaintaining a high quality of service and ethical behavior, and continuing our marketing and public relations efforts. Our brand promotion, reputation building, and\\nmedia strategies have involved significant costs and may not be successful. We anticipate that other competitors and potential competitors will expand their\\nofferings, which will make maintaining and enhancing our reputation and brand increasingly more difficult and expensive. If we fail to successfully maintain our\\nbrand in the current or future competitive environment or if events occur in the future which negatively affect public perception of our company, our brand and\\nreputation would be further damaged and our business may suffer.\\nOur historical workplace culture and forward-leaning approach created operational, compliance, and cultural challenges, and a failure to address these\\nchallenges would adversely impact our business, financial condition, operating results, and prospects.\\nOur historical workplace culture and forward-leaning approach created significant operational and cultural challenges that have in the past harmed, and may in\\nthe future continue to harm, our business results and financial condition. Our prior failure to prioritize compliance has led to increased regulatory scrutiny globally.\\nAlthough we have since made changes in our company’s cultural values and composition of our leadership team and have an ongoing commitment to promote\\ntransparency and collaboration, regulators may continue to perceive us negatively, which would adversely impact our business, financial condition, operating\\nresults, and prospects.\\nOur historical workplace culture also created a lack of transparency internally, which resulted in siloed teams that lacked coordination and knowledge sharing,\\ncausing misalignment and inefficiencies in operational and strategic objectives. Although we have since embraced a culture of enhanced transparency, these efforts\\nmay not be successful.\\nOur workforce and operations have grown substantially since our inception and we have in the past implemented several reductions in workforce. If we are\\nunable to optimize our organizational structure or effectively manage our growth or any future reductions in workforce, our financial performance and future\\nprospects will be adversely affected.\\nSince our inception, we have experienced rapid growth in the United States and internationally. This expansion increases the complexity of our business and\\nhas placed, and will continue to place, significant strain on our management, personnel, operations, systems, technical performance, financial resources, and\\ninternal financial control and reporting functions. We may not be able to manage our growth effectively, which could damage our reputation and negatively affect\\nour operating results.\\nAs our operations have expanded, we have grown from 159 employees as of December 31, 2012 to approximately 32,800 global employees as of\\nDecember\\xa031, 2022, of whom approximately 19,200 were located outside the United States. We expect the total number of our employees located outside the\\nUnited States to increase as we expand globally. Properly managing our growth will require us to continue to hire, train, and manage qualified employees and staff,\\nincluding engineers, operations personnel, financial and accounting staff, and sales and marketing staff, and to improve and maintain our technology. If our new\\nhires perform poorly, if we are unsuccessful in hiring, training, managing, and integrating new employees and staff, or if we are not successful in retaining our\\nexisting employees and staff, our business may be harmed. Moreover, in order to optimize our organizational structure, we have implemented several reductions in\\nworkforce and restructurings, including in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on our business, and may in the future implement other reductions\\nin workforce. Any reduction in workforce or restructuring may yield unintended consequences and costs, such as attrition beyond the intended reduction in\\nworkforce, the distraction of employees, or reduced employee morale and could adversely affect our reputation as an employer, which could make it more difficult\\nfor us to hire new employees in the future and increase the risk that we may not achieve the anticipated benefits from the reduction in workforce. Properly\\nmanaging our growth or any reductions in workforce will require us to establish consistent policies across regions and functions, and a failure to do so could\\nlikewise harm our business.\\n17\\nOur failure to upgrade our technology or network infrastructure effectively to support our growth could result in unanticipated system disruptions, slow\\nresponse times, or poor experiences for Drivers, consumers, merchants, Shippers, and Carriers. To manage the growth of our operations and personnel and improve\\nthe technology that supports our business operations, as well as our financial and management systems, disclosure controls and procedures, and internal controls\\nover financial reporting, we will be required to commit substantial financial, operational, and technical resources. In particular, we will need to improve our\\ntransaction processing and reporting, operational, and financial systems, procedures, and controls. For example, due to our significant growth, especially with\\nrespect to our high-growth emerging offerings like Delivery and Freight, we face challenges in timely and appropriately designing controls in response to evolving\\nrisks of material misstatement. These improvements are and will be particularly challenging when we acquire new businesses with different systems. Our current\\nand planned personnel, systems, procedures, and controls may not be adequate to support our future operations. If we are unable to expand our operations and hire\\nadditional qualified personnel in an efficient manner, or if our operational technology is insufficient to reliably service Drivers, consumers, merchants, Shippers, or\\nCarriers, platform user satisfaction will be adversely affected and may cause platform users to switch to our competitors’ platforms, which would adversely affect\\nour business, financial condition, and operating results.\\nOur organizational structure is complex and will continue to grow as we add additional Drivers, consumers, merchants, Carriers, Shippers, employees,\\nproducts and offerings, and technologies, and as we continue to expand globally. We will need to improve our operational, financial, and management controls as\\nwell as our reporting systems and procedures to support the growth of our organizational structure. We will require capital and management resources to grow and\\nmature in these areas. If we are unable to effectively manage the growth of our business, the quality of our platform may suffer, and we may be unable to address\\ncompetitive challenges, which would adversely affect our overall business, operations, and financial condition.\\nIf platform users engage in, or are subject to, criminal, violent, inappropriate, or dangerous activity that results in major safety incidents, our ability to attract\\nand retain Drivers, consumers, merchants, Shippers, and Carriers may be harmed, which could have an adverse impact on our reputation, business, financial\\ncondition, and operating results.\\nWe are not able to control or predict the actions of platform users and third parties, either during their use of our platform or otherwise, and we may be unable\\nto protect or provide a safe environment for Drivers and consumers as a result of certain actions by Drivers, consumers, merchants, Carriers, and third parties. Such\\nactions may result in injuries, property damage, or loss of life for consumers and third parties, or business interruption, brand and reputational damage, or\\nsignificant liabilities for us. Although we administer certain qualification processes for users of our platform, including background checks on Drivers through\\nthird-party service providers, these qualification processes and background checks may not expose all potentially relevant information and are limited in certain\\njurisdictions according to national and local laws, and our third-party service providers may fail to conduct such background checks adequately or disclose\\ninformation that could be relevant to a determination of eligibility. Further, the qualification and background check standards for Couriers are generally less\\nextensive than those conducted for Mobility Drivers. In addition, we do not independently test Drivers’ driving skills. Consequently, we expect to continue to\\nreceive complaints from riders and other consumers, as well as actual or threatened legal action against us related to Driver conduct. We have also faced civil\\nlitigation alleging, among other things, inadequate Driver qualification processes and background checks, and general misrepresentations regarding the safety of\\nour platform.\\nIf Drivers or Carriers, or individuals impersonating Drivers or Carriers, engage in criminal activity, misconduct, or inappropriate conduct or use our platform\\nas a conduit for criminal activity, consumers and Shippers may not consider our products and offerings safe, and we may receive negative press coverage as a result\\nof our business relationship with such Driver or Carrier, which would adversely impact our brand, reputation, and business. There have been numerous incidents\\nand allegations worldwide of Drivers, or individuals impersonating Drivers, sexually assaulting, abusing, kidnapping and/or fatally injuring consumers, or\\notherwise engaging in criminal activity while using our platform or claiming to use our platform. Furthermore, if consumers engage in criminal activity or\\nmisconduct while using our platform, Drivers and merchants may be unwilling to continue using our platform. In addition, certain regions where we operate have\\nhigh rates of violent crime, which has impacted Drivers and consumers in those regions. For example, in Latin America, there have been numerous and increasing\\nreports of Drivers and consumers being victimized by violent crime, such as armed robbery, violent assault, and rape, while taking or providing a trip on our\\nplatform. If other criminal, inappropriate, or other negative incidents occur due to the conduct of platform users or third parties, our ability to attract platform users\\nmay be harmed, and our business and financial results could be adversely affected.\\nPublic reporting or disclosure of reported safety information, including information about safety incidents reportedly occurring on or related to our platform,\\nwhether generated by us or third parties such as media or regulators, may adversely impact our business and financial results.\\nFurther, we may be subject to claims of significant liability based on traffic accidents, deaths, injuries, or other incidents that are caused by Drivers, consumers,\\nor third parties while using our platform, or even when Drivers, consumers, or third parties are not actively using our platform. On a smaller scale, we may face\\nlitigation related to claims by Drivers for the actions of consumers or third parties. Furthermore, operating a motor vehicle is inherently dangerous. In addition, the\\ngrowth of our Delivery offering has led to an increase in Couriers on two wheel vehicles such as scooters and bicycles, who are more vulnerable road users and\\nface a more severe level of injury in the event of a collision than that faced while driving in a vehicle. For example, urban hazards such as unpaved or uneven\\nroadways increase the risk and severity of potential injuries. In addition, Couriers, in particular those on two wheel vehicles\\n18\\npredominantly in metropolitan areas, need to share, navigate, and at times contend with narrow and heavily congested roads occupied by cars, buses and light rail,\\nespecially during “rush” hours, all of which heighten the potential risk of injuries or death. Our auto liability and general liability insurance policies may not cover\\nall potential claims to which we are exposed, and may not be adequate to indemnify us for all liability. These incidents may subject us to liability and negative\\npublicity, which would increase our operating costs and adversely affect our business, operating results, and future prospects. Even if these claims do not result in\\nliability, we will incur significant costs in investigating and defending against them. As we expand our products and offerings, such as Freight, this insurance risk\\nwill grow.\\nWe are making substantial investments in new offerings and technologies, and may increase such investments in the future. These new ventures are inherently\\nrisky, and we may never realize any expected benefits from them.\\nWe have made substantial investments to develop new offerings and technologies, and we intend to continue investing significant resources in developing new\\ntechnologies, tools, features, services, products and offerings. For example, through our acquisition of Cornershop, a provider of online grocery delivery in several\\ncountries including Mexico and Chile, we expanded our Delivery offering to grocery delivery. Additionally, in October 2021, we acquired The Drizly Group, Inc.,\\nwhich operates an on-demand alcohol marketplace in North America, in order to further expand our Delivery offering to alcohol. In November 2021, our subsidiary\\nUber Freight acquired Transplace, expanding Uber Freight’s business through Transplace’s expertise in transportation management. We also plan to invest\\nsignificant resources to develop and expand new offerings and technologies in the markets in which Careem and Postmates operate. If we do not spend our\\ndevelopment budget efficiently or effectively on commercially successful and innovative technologies, we may not realize the expected benefits of our strategy.\\nOur new initiatives also have a high degree of risk, as each involves nascent industries and unproven business strategies and technologies with which we have\\nlimited or no prior development or operating experience. Because such offerings and technologies are new, they will likely involve claims and liabilities (including,\\nbut not limited to, personal injury claims), expenses, regulatory challenges, and other risks, some of which we do not currently anticipate.\\nThere can be no assurance that consumer demand for such initiatives will exist or be sustained at the levels that we anticipate, or that any of these initiatives\\nwill gain sufficient traction or market acceptance to generate sufficient revenue to offset any new expenses or liabilities associated with these new investments. It is\\nalso possible that products and offerings developed by others will render our products and offerings noncompetitive or obsolete. Further, our development efforts\\nwith respect to new products, offerings and technologies could distract management from current operations, and will divert capital and other resources from our\\nmore established products, offerings and technologies. Even if we are successful in developing new products, offerings or technologies, regulatory authorities may\\nsubject us to new rules or restrictions in response to our innovations that could increase our expenses or prevent us from successfully commercializing new\\nproducts, offerings or technologies. If we do not realize the expected benefits of our investments, our business, financial condition, operating results, and prospects\\nmay be harmed.\\nOur business is substantially dependent on operations outside the United States, including those in markets in which we have limited experience, and if we are\\nunable to manage the risks presented by our business model internationally, our financial results and future prospects will be adversely impacted.\\nAs of December\\xa031, 2022, we operated in approximately 70 countries, and markets outside the United States accounted for approximately 76% of all Trips. We\\nhave limited experience operating in many jurisdictions outside of the United States and have made, and expect to continue to make, significant investments to\\nexpand our international operations and compete with local and other global competitors. For example, our acquisitions of Careem and Cornershop may not be\\nsuccessful and may negatively affect our operating results.\\nConducting our business internationally, particularly in countries in which we have limited experience, subjects us to risks that we do not face to the same\\ndegree in the United States. These risks include, among others:\\n•\\noperational and compliance challenges caused by distance, language, and cultural differences;\\n•\\nthe resources required to localize our business, which requires the translation of our mobile app and website into foreign languages and the adaptation\\nof our operations to local practices, laws, and regulations and any changes in such practices, laws, and regulations;\\n•\\nlaws and regulations more restrictive than those in the United States, including laws governing competition, pricing, payment methods, Internet\\nactivities, transportation services (such as taxis and vehicles for hire), transportation network companies (such as ridesharing), logistics services,\\npayment processing and payment gateways, real estate tenancy laws, tax and social security laws, employment and labor laws, driver screening and\\nbackground checks, licensing regulations, email messaging, privacy, location services, collection, use, processing, or sharing of personal information,\\nownership of intellectual property, and other activities important to our business;\\n•\\ncompetition with companies or other services (such as taxis or vehicles for hire) that understand local markets better than we do, that have pre-existing\\nrelationships with potential platform users in those markets, or that are favored by government or regulatory authorities in those markets;\\n•\\ndiffering levels of social acceptance of our brand, products, and offerings;\\n19\\n•\\ndiffering levels of technological compatibility with our platform;\\n•\\nexposure to business cultures in which improper business practices may be prevalent;\\n•\\nlegal uncertainty regarding our liability for the actions of platform users and third parties, including uncertainty resulting from unique local laws or a\\nlack of clear legal precedent;\\n•\\ndifficulties in managing, growing, and staffing international operations, including in countries in which foreign employees may become part of labor\\nunions, employee representative bodies, or collective bargaining agreements, and challenges relating to work stoppages or slowdowns;\\n•\\nfluctuations in currency exchange rates;\\n•\\nmanaging operations in markets in which cash transactions are favored over credit or debit cards;\\n•\\nregulations governing the control of local currencies that impact our ability to collect fares on behalf of Drivers and remit those funds to Drivers in the\\nsame currencies, as well as higher levels of credit risk and payment fraud;\\n•\\nadverse tax consequences, including the complexities of foreign value added and digital services tax systems, and restrictions on the repatriation of\\nearnings;\\n•\\nincreased financial accounting and reporting burdens, and complexities associated with implementing and maintaining adequate internal controls;\\n•\\ndifficulties in implementing and maintaining the financial systems and processes needed to enable compliance across multiple offerings and\\njurisdictions;\\n•\\nimport and export restrictions and changes in trade regulation;\\n•\\npolitical, social, and economic instability abroad, war, including the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, terrorist attacks and security concerns in\\ngeneral, and societal crime conditions that harm or disrupt the global economy and/or can directly impact platform users;\\n•\\npublic health concerns or emergencies, including pandemics and other highly communicable diseases or viruses, outbreaks of which have from time to\\ntime occurred in various parts of the world in which we operate; and\\n•\\nreduced or varied protection for intellectual property rights in some markets.\\nThese risks could adversely affect our international operations, which could in turn adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results.\\nWe have limited influence over our minority-owned affiliates, which subjects us to substantial risks, including potential loss of value.\\nOur growth strategy has included the restructuring of our business and assets by divesting our business and assets in certain jurisdictions and partnering with\\nand investing in local ridesharing, and delivery companies to participate in those markets rather than operate in those markets independently. Our growth strategy\\nhas also included the divestment of certain lines of businesses in its entirety, and not just in certain jurisdictions, and instead partnering and investing in our\\ncompetitors in those lines of businesses. As a result, a significant portion of our assets includes minority ownership positions, including in Didi, Grab, our\\nYandex.Taxi joint venture, Lime, and Aurora.\\nOur ownership in these entities involves significant risks that are outside our control. We are not represented on the management team or board of directors of\\nDidi, and therefore we do not participate in its day-to-day management or the actions taken by the board of directors of Didi. We are not represented on the\\nmanagement teams of Grab, our Yandex.Taxi joint venture, Lime or Aurora, and therefore do not participate in the day-to-day management of Grab, our\\nYandex.Taxi joint venture, Lime or Aurora. Although we are represented on each of the boards of directors of Grab, our Yandex.Taxi joint venture, Lime and\\nAurora, we do not have a controlling influence on those boards. As a result, the boards of directors or management teams of these companies may make decisions\\nor take actions with which we disagree or that may be harmful to the value of our ownership in these companies. Additionally, these companies have expanded their\\nofferings, and we expect them to continue to expand their offerings in the future, to compete with us in various markets throughout the world. While this could\\nenhance the value of our ownership interest in these companies, our business, financial condition, operating results, and prospects would be adversely affected by\\nsuch expansion into markets in which we operate.\\nAny material decline in the business of these entities would adversely affect the value of our assets and our financial results. Furthermore, the value of these\\nassets is based in part on the market valuations of these entities, and weakened financial markets have adversely affected, and may in the future adversely affect\\nsuch valuations. To the extent these businesses are or become publicly traded companies, volatility or fluctuations in the stock price of such companies could\\nadversely impact our financial results. These positions could expose us to risks, litigation, and unknown liabilities because, among other things, these companies\\nhave limited operating histories in evolving industries and may have less predictable operating results; to the extent these companies are privately owned, limited\\npublic information is available and we may not learn all the material information regarding these businesses; are\\n20\\ndomiciled and operate in countries with particular economic, tax, political, legal, safety, regulatory and public health risks, including the extent of the impact of the\\nCOVID-19 pandemic on their business; are domiciled or operate in countries that may become subject to economic sanctions or foreign investment restrictions;\\ndepend on the management talents and efforts of a small group of individuals, and, as a result, the death, disability, resignation, or termination of one or more of\\nthese individuals could have an adverse effect on the relevant company’s operations; and will likely require substantial additional capital to support their operations\\nand expansion and to maintain their competitive positions. For example, in light of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, members of our management team\\nresigned from the board of our Yandex.Taxi joint venture, and we announced that we are actively looking for opportunities to accelerate the sale of our remaining\\nholdings in the joint venture. The broader consequences of this conflict, which may include additional international sanctions, embargoes, regional instability, and\\ngeopolitical shifts, increased tensions between the United States and countries in which we operate, and the extent of the conflict’s effect on the global economy,\\ncannot be predicted. Any of these risks could materially affect the value of our assets, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition,\\noperating results, or the trading price of our common stock.\\nFurther, we are contractually limited in our ability to sell or transfer these assets. For example, in connection with Aurora’s November 2021 initial public\\noffering, we are subject to a 4-year lock-up with respect to our shares in Aurora. Furthermore, we may be required to sell these assets at a time at which we would\\nnot be able to realize what we believe to be the long-term value of these assets. For example, if we were deemed an investment company under the Investment\\nCompany Act of 1940, as amended (the “Investment Company Act”), we may be required to sell some or all of such assets so that we would not be subject to the\\nrequirements of the Investment Company Act. Additionally, we may have to pay significant taxes upon the sale or transfer of these assets. Accordingly, we may\\nnever realize the value of these assets relative to the contributions we made to these businesses.\\nWe may experience significant fluctuations in our operating results. If we are unable to achieve or sustain profitability, our prospects would be adversely\\naffected and investors may lose some or all of the value of their investment.\\nOur operating results may vary significantly and are not necessarily an indication of future performance. These fluctuations may be a result of a variety of\\nfactors, some of which are beyond our control. In addition, we experience seasonal fluctuations in our financial results. For Mobility, we typically generate higher\\nrevenue in our fourth quarter compared to other quarters due in part to fourth quarter holiday and business demand, and typically generate lower revenue in our\\nthird quarter compared to other quarters due in part to less usage of our platform during peak vacation season in certain cities, such as Paris. We have typically\\nexperienced lower quarter-over-quarter growth in Mobility in the first quarter. For Delivery, we expect to experience seasonal increases in our revenue in the first\\nand fourth quarters compared to the second and third quarters, although the historical growth of Delivery has masked these seasonal fluctuations. In 2022, we\\nexperienced altered seasonality as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and related restrictions. These primarily relate to COVID-19 variant outbreaks that drove\\nlower Mobility volume and higher Delivery volume. We expect that seasonality will return to its historic patterns as recovery from the pandemic continues. Our\\ngrowth has made, and may in the future make, seasonal fluctuations difficult to detect. We expect these seasonal trends to become more pronounced over time as\\nour growth slows. Other seasonal trends may develop or these existing seasonal trends may become more extreme, which would contribute to fluctuations in our\\noperating results. In addition to seasonality, our operating results may fluctuate as a result of factors including our ability to attract and retain new platform users,\\nincreased competition in the markets in which we operate, our ability to expand our operations in new and existing markets, our ability to maintain an adequate\\ngrowth rate and effectively manage that growth, our ability to keep pace with technological changes in the industries in which we operate, changes in governmental\\nor other regulations affecting our business, harm to our brand or reputation, and other risks described elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. As such, we\\nmay not accurately forecast our operating results. We base our expense levels and investment plans on estimates. A significant portion of our expenses and\\ninvestments are fixed, and we may not be able to adjust our spending quickly enough if our revenue is less than expected, resulting in losses that exceed our\\nexpectations. If we are unable to achieve sustained profits, our prospects would be adversely affected and investors may lose some or all of the value of their\\ninvestment.\\nIf our growth slows more significantly than we currently expect, we may not be able to achieve profitability, which would adversely affect our financial results\\nand future prospects.\\nWe believe that our growth depends on a number of factors, including our ability to:\\n•\\ngrow supply and demand on our platform;\\n•\\nincrease existing platform users’ activity on our platform;\\n•\\ncontinue to introduce our platform to new markets;\\n•\\nprovide high-quality support to Drivers, consumers, merchants, Shippers, and Carriers;\\n•\\nexpand our business and increase our market share and category position;\\n•\\ncompete with the products and offerings of, and pricing and incentives offered by, our competitors;\\n•\\ndevelop new products, offerings, and technologies;\\n•\\nidentify and acquire or invest in businesses, products, offerings, or technologies that we believe could complement or\\n21\\nexpand our platform;\\n•\\npenetrate suburban and rural areas and increase the number of rides taken on our platform outside metropolitan areas;\\n•\\nreduce the costs of our Mobility offering to better compete with personal vehicle ownership and usage and other low-cost alternatives like public\\ntransportation, which in many cases can be faster or cheaper than any other form of transportation;\\n•\\nmaintain existing local regulations in key markets where we operate;\\n•\\nenter or expand operations in some of the key countries in which we are currently limited by local regulations, such as Argentina, Germany, Italy,\\nJapan, South Korea, and Spain; and\\n•\\nincrease positive perception of our brand.\\nWe may not successfully accomplish any of these objectives. In addition, circumstances that have accelerated the growth of our Delivery offering stemming\\nfrom stay-at-home order demand related to COVID-19 may not continue in the future. A softening of Driver, consumer, merchant, Shipper, or Carrier demand,\\nwhether caused by changes in the preferences of such parties, failure to maintain our brand, changes in the U.S. or global economies, pandemics, licensing fees in\\nvarious jurisdictions, competition, or other factors, may result in decreased revenue or growth and our financial results and future prospects would be adversely\\nimpacted. We expect to continue to incur significant expenses, and if we cannot increase our revenue at a faster rate than the increase in our expenses, we will not\\nachieve profitability.\\nWe generate a significant percentage of our Gross Bookings from trips in large metropolitan areas and trips to and from airports. If our operations in large\\nmetropolitan areas or ability to provide trips to and from airports are negatively affected, our financial results and future prospects would be adversely\\nimpacted.\\nIn 2022, we derived 22% of our Mobility Gross Bookings from five metropolitan areas—Chicago, Los Angeles, and New York City in the United States, Sao\\nPaulo in Brazil, and London in the United Kingdom. We experience strong competition in large metropolitan areas, which has led us to offer significant Driver\\nincentives and consumer discounts and promotions in these large metropolitan areas. As a result of our geographic concentration, our business and financial results\\nare susceptible to economic, social, weather, and regulatory conditions or other circumstances in each of these large metropolitan areas. Outbreaks of contagious\\ndiseases or other viruses could lead to a sustained decline in the desirability of living, working and congregating in metropolitan areas in which we operate. Any\\nshort-term or long-term shifts in the travel patterns of consumers away from metropolitan areas, due to health concerns regarding epidemics or pandemics could\\nhave an adverse impact on our Mobility Gross Bookings from these areas. An economic downturn, increased competition, or regulatory obstacles in any of these\\nkey metropolitan areas would adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results to a much greater degree than would the occurrence of such\\nevents in other areas. In addition, any changes to local laws or regulations within these key metropolitan areas that affect our ability to operate or increase our\\noperating expenses in these markets would have an adverse effect on our business. Furthermore, if we are unable to renew existing licenses or do not receive new\\nlicenses in key metropolitan areas where we operate or such licenses are terminated, any inability to operate in such metropolitan area, as well as the publicity\\nconcerning any such termination or non-renewal, could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results.\\nFurther, we expect that we will continue to face challenges in penetrating lower-density suburban and rural areas, where our network is smaller and less liquid,\\nthe cost of personal vehicle ownership is lower, and personal vehicle ownership is more convenient. If we are not successful in penetrating suburban and rural\\nareas, or if we are unable to operate in certain key metropolitan areas in the future, our ability to serve what we consider to be our total addressable market would\\nbe limited, and our business, financial condition, and operating results would suffer.\\nIn 2022, we generated 15% of our Mobility Gross Bookings from trips that either started or were completed at an airport. As a result of this concentration, our\\noperating results are susceptible to existing regulations and regulatory changes that impact the ability of drivers using our platform to provide trips to and from\\nairports. Sustained declines in air travel have in the past, and may in the future, suppress demand for airport-related Mobility and reduce our Mobility Gross\\nBookings from airport trips. For example, during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, travel behavior changed and airline travel slowed, reducing the demand\\nfor Mobility to and from airports. Certain airports currently regulate ridesharing within airport boundaries, including by mandating that ridesharing service\\nproviders obtain airport-specific licenses, and some airports, particularly those outside the United States, have banned ridesharing operations altogether. Despite\\nsuch bans, some Drivers continue to provide Mobility services, including trips to and from airports, despite lacking the requisite permits. Such actions may result in\\nthe imposition of fines or sanctions, including further bans on our ability to operate within airport boundaries, against us or Drivers. Additional bans on our airport\\noperations, or any permitting requirements or instances of non-compliance by Drivers, would significantly disrupt our operations. In addition, if drop-offs or pick-\\nups of riders become inconvenient because of airport rules or regulations, or more expensive because of airport-imposed fees, the number of Drivers or consumers\\ncould decrease, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results. While we have entered into agreements with most major U.S.\\nairports as well as certain airports outside the United States to allow the use of our platform within airport boundaries, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to\\nrenew such agreements on favorable terms if at all, and we may not be successful in negotiating similar agreements with airports in all jurisdictions.\\n22\\nIf we fail to offer autonomous vehicle technologies on our platform or fail to offer such technologies on our platform before our competitors, or if such\\ntechnologies fail to perform as expected, are inferior to those offered by our competitors, or are perceived as less safe than those offered by competitors or non-\\nautonomous vehicles, our financial performance and prospects would be adversely impacted.\\nWe have invested, and we may continue to invest, substantial amounts in companies with whom we partner to offer autonomous vehicle technologies on our\\nplatform. For example, in January 2021, we completed the merger of our autonomous technologies business with Aurora, and included a $400 million investment\\nin the combined company and a commercial agreement pursuant to which we and Aurora will collaborate with respect to the launch and commercialization of self-\\ndriving vehicles on our ridesharing network. We believe that autonomous vehicle technologies may have the ability to meaningfully impact the industries in which\\nwe compete and that autonomous vehicles present substantial opportunities. Several companies other than Aurora, including Waymo, Cruise Automation, Tesla,\\nApple, Zoox (which Amazon has acquired), Aptiv, and Nuro, are developing autonomous vehicle technologies, either alone or through collaborations with car\\nmanufacturers, and we expect that they will use such technology to further compete with us in the mobility, delivery, or logistics industries. Waymo has already\\nintroduced a commercialized ridehailing fleet of autonomous vehicles, and it is possible that our competitors could introduce autonomous vehicle offerings earlier\\nthan we will be able to offer autonomous vehicles on our platform through our commercial agreement with Aurora or other partners. In the event that our\\ncompetitors bring autonomous vehicles to market before we are able to offer autonomous vehicles on our platform, or their technology is or is perceived to be\\nsuperior to the technology of parties with which we partner to offer autonomous vehicles on our platform, they may be able to leverage such technology to compete\\nmore effectively with us, which would adversely impact our financial performance and our prospects. For example, use of autonomous vehicles could substantially\\nreduce the cost of providing ridesharing, delivery, or logistics services, which could allow competitors to offer such services at a substantially lower price as\\ncompared to the price available to consumers on our platform. If a significant number of consumers choose to use our competitors’ offerings over ours, our\\nfinancial performance and prospects would be adversely impacted.\\nAutonomous vehicle technologies involve significant risks and liabilities. Collisions, including fatal collisions, have happened. Failures of autonomous vehicle\\ntechnologies that we may offer on our platform or crashes involving autonomous vehicles using the technology of our partners, could generate substantial liability\\nfor us, create negative publicity about us, or result in regulatory scrutiny, all of which would have an adverse effect on our reputation, brand, business, prospects,\\nand operating results.\\nFederal and state government regulations specifically designed to govern autonomous vehicle operation, testing and/or manufacture are developing. These\\nregulations could include requirements that delay or limit our ability to offer autonomous vehicles on our platform. If regulations of this nature are implemented,\\nwe may not be able to offer autonomous vehicle technologies on our platform in the manner we expect, or at all. Further, if we or parties with which we partner to\\noffer autonomous vehicle technologies are unable to comply with existing or new regulations or laws applicable to autonomous vehicles, we and our partners could\\nbecome subject to substantial fines or penalties.\\nOur business depends on retaining and attracting high-quality personnel, and continued attrition, future attrition, or unsuccessful succession planning could\\nadversely affect our business.\\nOur success depends in large part on our ability to attract and retain high-quality management, operations, engineering, and other personnel who are in high\\ndemand, are often subject to competing employment offers, and are attractive recruiting targets for our competitors. Challenges related to our historical culture and\\nworkplace practices and negative publicity we experience have in the past led to significant attrition and made it more difficult to attract high-quality employees.\\nOur employees worked from home for almost two years in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, and although we have implemented our “return to office” plan, which\\nincludes a shift to a hybrid model where employees have flexibility to work from home, a hybrid model may create challenges, including challenges maintaining\\nour corporate culture, productivity and availability of key personnel and other employees necessary to conduct our business, increasing attrition or limiting our\\nability to attract employees if individuals prefer to work full time at home or in the office. Future challenges related to our culture and workplace practices or\\nadditional negative publicity could lead to further attrition and difficulty attracting high-quality employees.\\nFuture leadership transitions and management changes may cause uncertainty in, or a disruption to, our business, and may increase the likelihood of senior\\nmanagement or other employee turnover. The loss of qualified executives and employees, or an inability to attract, retain, and motivate high-quality executives and\\nemployees required for the planned expansion of our business, may harm our operating results and impair our ability to grow.\\nIn addition, we depend on the continued services and performance of our key personnel, including our Chief Executive Officer Dara Khosrowshahi. We have\\nentered into an employment agreement with Mr. Khosrowshahi, which is at-will and has no specific duration.\\nIn addition, our failure to put in place adequate succession plans for senior and key management roles or the failure of key employees to successfully transition\\ninto new roles, for example, as a result of reductions in workforce, organizational changes and attrition, could have an adverse effect on our business and operating\\nresults. The unexpected or abrupt departure of one or more of our key personnel and the failure to effectively transfer knowledge and effect smooth key personnel\\ntransitions has had and may in the future have an adverse effect on our business resulting from the loss of such person’s skills, knowledge of our business, and\\nyears of\\n23\\nindustry experience. If we cannot effectively manage leadership transitions and management changes in the future, our reputation and future business prospects\\ncould be adversely affected.\\nTo attract and retain key personnel, we use equity incentives, among other measures. These measures may not be sufficient to attract and retain the personnel\\nwe require to operate our business effectively. Further, the equity incentives we currently use to attract, retain, and motivate employees may not be as effective as in\\nthe past, particularly if the value of the underlying stock does not increase commensurate with expectations or consistent with our historical stock price growth. If\\nwe are unable to attract and retain high-quality management and operating personnel, our business, financial condition, and operating results could be adversely\\naffected. In addition, we rely heavily on equity as a component of compensation, which may not always align with the Company\\'s business and financial interests.\\nWe have experienced, and may experience security or privacy breaches or other unauthorized or improper access to, use of, disclosure of, alteration of or\\ndestruction of our proprietary or confidential data, employee data, or platform user data, which could cause loss of revenue, harm to our brand, business\\ndisruption, and significant liabilities.\\nWe collect, use, and process a variety of personal data, such as email addresses, mobile phone numbers, profile photos, location information, drivers’ license\\nnumbers and Social Security numbers of Drivers, consumer payment card information, and Driver and merchant bank account information. As such, we are an\\nattractive target of data security attacks by third parties. Any failure to prevent or mitigate security breaches or improper access to, or use, acquisition, disclosure,\\nalteration or destruction of, any such data could result in significant liability and a material loss of revenue resulting from the adverse impact on our reputation and\\nbrand, a diminished ability to retain or attract new platform users, and disruption to our business. We rely on third-party service providers to host or otherwise\\nprocess some of our data and that of platform users, and any failure by such third party to prevent or mitigate security breaches or improper access to, or use,\\nacquisition, disclosure, alteration, or destruction of, such information could have similar adverse consequences for us.\\nBecause the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade services, or sabotage systems change frequently and are often unrecognizable\\nuntil launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques and implement adequate preventative measures. Our servers and platform may be\\nvulnerable to computer viruses or physical or electronic break-ins that our security measures may not detect. Individuals able to circumvent our security measures\\nmay misappropriate confidential, proprietary, or personal information held by or on behalf of us, disrupt our operations, damage our computers, or otherwise\\ndamage our business. In addition, we may need to expend significant resources to protect against security breaches or mitigate the impact of any such breaches,\\nincluding potential liability that may not be limited to the amounts covered by our insurance.\\nSecurity breaches could also expose us to liability under various laws and regulations across jurisdictions and increase the risk of litigation and governmental\\ninvestigation. We have been subject to security and privacy incidents in the past and may be again in the future. For example, in September 2022, we experienced a\\ncybersecurity incident where an attacker accessed several internal systems. As an earlier example, in May 2014, we experienced a data security incident in which\\nan outside actor gained access to certain personal information belonging to Drivers through an access key written into code that an employee had unintentionally\\nposted publicly on a code-sharing website used by software developers (the “2014 Breach”). In October and November of 2016, outside actors downloaded the\\npersonal data of approximately 57\\xa0million Drivers and consumers worldwide (the “2016 Breach”). The accessed data included the names, email addresses, mobile\\nphone numbers, and drivers’ license numbers of approximately 600,000 Drivers, among other information. For further information on this incident, see the risk\\nfactors titled “—We currently are subject to a number of inquiries, investigations, and requests for information from the DOJ, state Attorney General (“AG”)\\noffices, and other U.S. and foreign government agencies, the adverse outcomes of which could harm our business” and “—We face risks related to our collection,\\nuse, transfer, disclosure, and other processing of data, which could result in investigations, inquiries, litigation, fines, legislative, and regulatory action, and negative\\npress about our privacy and data protection practices,” below. As we expand our operations, we may also assume liabilities for breaches experienced by the\\ncompanies we acquire. For example, in April 2018, Careem publicly disclosed and notified relevant regulatory authorities that it had been subject to a data security\\nincident that allowed access to certain personal information of riders and drivers on its platform, as of January 14, 2018. If Careem becomes subject to liability as a\\nresult of this or other data security incidents, or if we fail to remediate this or any other data security incident that Careem or we experience, we may face harm to\\nour brand, business disruption, and significant liabilities. In addition, in July 2020, Drizly publicly disclosed that it had been subject to a data security incident that\\nallowed access to certain personal information of customers on its platform, and in November 2021 Drizly obtained final court approval of a settlement in a\\nresulting class action litigation. Moreover, in January 2023, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (the “FTC”) announced a final order relating to the data security\\nincident. If Drizly becomes subject to additional liability or regulatory or court orders as a result of this or other data security incidents or if we fail to remediate\\nthis or any other data security incident that Drizly or we experience, we may face harm to our brand, business disruption, and significant liabilities. Security and\\nprivacy incidents have led to, and may continue to lead to, additional regulatory scrutiny.\\n24\\nCyberattacks, including computer malware, ransomware, viruses, denial of service attacks, spamming, phishing and social engineering attacks could harm our\\nreputation, business, and operating results.\\nWe rely heavily on information technology systems across our operations. Our information technology systems, including mobile and online platforms and\\nmobile payment systems, administrative functions such as human resources, payroll, accounting, and internal and external communications, and the information\\ntechnology systems of our third-party business partners and service providers, contain proprietary or confidential information related to business and personal data,\\nincluding sensitive personal data, entrusted to us by platform users, employees, and job candidates. Cyberattacks that leverage computer malware, ransomware,\\nviruses, denial of service attacks, spamming, phishing, and social engineering have become more prevalent, have occurred on our systems in the past, and may\\noccur on our systems in the future. Cyberthreats are constantly evolving and employing more sophisticated attack techniques. Our detection capabilities may not be\\nsufficient to prevent or detect a sophisticated cyberattacker, such as a nation state using a zero day exploit or unknown malware. Breaches of our facilities, network,\\napplications, identity management solutions or data security have in the past and could in the future disrupt the security of our systems and platforms, impair our\\nability to protect data, compromise confidential or technical business information harming our reputation or competitive position, result in theft or misuse of our\\nintellectual property or other assets, subject us to regulatory scrutiny or legal liability, require us to allocate more resources to improve technologies, or otherwise\\nadversely affect our reputation, business and operating results. In addition, our increase in hybrid and remote working arrangements may heighten the foregoing\\nrisks.\\nVarious other factors may also cause system failures or security breaches, including power outages, catastrophic events, inadequate or ineffective redundancy,\\nissues with upgrading or creating new systems or platforms, flaws in third-party software or services, errors by our employees or third-party service providers, or\\nbreaches in the security of these systems or platforms. For example, fraudsters may attempt to induce employees, contractors, or platform users to disclose\\ninformation to gain access to our data or the data of platform users. If our incident response, disaster recovery, and business continuity plans do not resolve these\\nissues in an effective manner, they could result in adverse impacts to our business operations and our financial results. Because of our prominence, the number of\\nplatform users, and the types and volume of personal data on our systems, we may be a particularly attractive target for such attacks. Although we have developed,\\nand continue to develop, systems and processes that are designed to protect our data and that of platform users, and to prevent data loss, undesirable activities on\\nour platform, and security breaches, we cannot guarantee that such measures will provide absolute security. Our efforts on this front may be unsuccessful as a result\\nof, for example, software bugs or other technical malfunctions; employee, contractor, or vendor error or malfeasance; government surveillance; or other threats that\\nevolve, and we may incur significant costs in protecting against or remediating cyber-attacks. Any actual or perceived failure to maintain the performance,\\nreliability, security, and availability of our products, offerings, and technical infrastructure to the satisfaction of platform users and certain regulators would likely\\nharm our reputation and result in loss of revenue from the adverse impact to our reputation and brand, disruption to our business, and our decreased ability to attract\\nand retain Drivers, consumers, merchants, Shippers, and Carriers.\\nIf we are unable to successfully introduce new or upgraded products, offerings, or features for Drivers, consumers, merchants, Shippers, and Carriers, we may\\nfail to retain and attract such users to our platform and our operating results would be adversely affected.\\nTo continue to retain and attract Drivers, consumers, merchants, Shippers, and Carriers to our platform, we will need to continue to invest in the development\\nof new products, offerings, and features that add value for Drivers, consumers, merchants, Shippers, and Carriers and that differentiate us from our competitors. For\\nexample, in January 2020, we introduced a number of product changes in California intended to, among other things, provide Drivers with more information about\\nrider destinations, trip distance, and expected fares, display prices more clearly, and allow users to select preferred Drivers, all of which are intended to further\\nstrengthen the independence of Drivers in California and protect their ability to work flexibly when using the Uber platform.\\nDeveloping and delivering these new or upgraded products, offerings, and features is costly, and the success of such new products, offerings, and features\\ndepends on several factors, including the timely completion, introduction, and market acceptance of such products, offerings, and features. Moreover, any such new\\nor upgraded products, offerings, or features may not work as intended or may not provide intended value to platform users. For example, some product changes in\\nCalifornia have resulted in, and may continue to result in, reduced demand for rides and reduced supply of Drivers on our platform, Driver dissatisfaction, and\\nadverse impacts on the operation of our platform. If we are unable to continue to develop new or upgraded products, offerings, and features, or if platform users do\\nnot perceive value in such new or upgraded products, offerings, and features, platform users may choose not to use our platform, which would adversely affect our\\noperating results.\\nWe track certain operational metrics and our category position with internal systems and tools, and our equity stakes in minority-owned affiliates with\\ninformation provided by such minority-owned affiliates, and do not independently verify such metrics. Certain of our operational metrics are subject to\\ninherent challenges in measurement, and real or perceived inaccuracies in such metrics may harm our reputation and negatively affect our business.\\nWe track certain operational metrics, including key metrics such as MAPCs, Trips, Gross Bookings, and our category position, with internal systems and tools,\\nand our equity stakes in minority-owned affiliates with information provided by such minority-owned affiliates, that are not independently verified by any third\\nparty and which may differ from estimates or similar metrics published by\\n25\\nthird parties due to differences in sources, methodologies, or the assumptions on which we rely. Our internal systems and tools have a number of limitations, and\\nour methodologies for tracking these metrics may change over time, which could result in unexpected changes to our metrics, including the metrics we publicly\\ndisclose, or our estimates of our category position. If the internal systems and tools we use to track these metrics undercount or overcount performance or contain\\nalgorithmic or other technical errors, the data we report may not be accurate. While these numbers are based on what we believe to be reasonable estimates of our\\nmetrics for the applicable period of measurement, there are inherent challenges in measuring how our products are used across large populations globally. For\\nexample, we believe that there are consumers who have multiple accounts, even though we prohibit that in our Terms of Service and implement measures to detect\\nand prevent that behavior. In addition, limitations or errors with respect to how we measure data or with respect to the data that we measure may affect our\\nunderstanding of certain details of our business, which could affect our long-term strategies. If our operating metrics or our estimates of our category position or\\nour equity stakes in our minority-owned affiliates are not accurate representations of our business, or if investors do not perceive our operating metrics or estimates\\nof our category position or equity stakes in our minority-owned affiliates to be accurate, or if we discover material inaccuracies with respect to these figures, our\\nreputation may be significantly harmed, and our operating and financial results could be adversely affected.\\nIn certain jurisdictions, we allow consumers to pay for rides and meal or grocery deliveries using cash, which raises numerous regulatory, operational, and\\nsafety concerns. If we do not successfully manage those concerns, we could become subject to adverse regulatory actions and suffer reputational harm or other\\nadverse financial and accounting consequences.\\nIn certain jurisdictions, including India, Brazil, and Mexico, as well as certain other countries in Latin America, Europe, the Middle East, and Africa, we allow\\nconsumers to use cash to pay Drivers the entire fare of rides and cost of meal deliveries (including our service fee from such rides and meal or grocery deliveries).\\nIn 2022, cash-paid trips accounted for approximately 6% of our global Gross Bookings. This percentage may increase in the future, particularly in the markets in\\nwhich Careem operates. The use of cash in connection with our technology raises numerous regulatory, operational, and safety concerns. For example, many\\njurisdictions have specific regulations regarding the use of cash for ridesharing and certain jurisdictions prohibit the use of cash for ridesharing. Failure to comply\\nwith these regulations could result in the imposition of significant fines and penalties and could result in a regulator requiring that we suspend operations in those\\njurisdictions. In addition to these regulatory concerns, the use of cash with our Mobility products and Delivery offering can increase safety and security risks for\\nDrivers and riders, including potential robbery, assault, violent or fatal attacks, and other criminal acts. In certain jurisdictions such as Brazil, serious safety\\nincidents resulting in robberies and violent, fatal attacks on Drivers while using our platform have been reported. If we are not able to adequately address any of\\nthese concerns, we could suffer significant reputational harm, which could adversely impact our business.\\nIn addition, establishing the proper infrastructure to ensure that we receive the correct service fee on cash trips is complex, and has in the past meant and may\\ncontinue to mean that we cannot collect the entire service fee for certain of our cash-based trips. We have created systems for Drivers to collect and deposit the cash\\nreceived for cash-based trips and deliveries, as well as systems for us to collect, deposit, and properly account for the cash received, some of which are not always\\neffective, convenient, or widely-adopted by Drivers. Creating, maintaining, and improving these systems requires significant effort and resources, and we cannot\\nguarantee these systems will be effective in collecting amounts due to us. Further, operating a business that uses cash raises compliance risks with respect to a\\nvariety of rules and regulations, including anti-money laundering laws. If Drivers fail to pay us under the terms of our agreements or if our collection systems fail,\\nwe may be adversely affected by both the inability to collect amounts due and the cost of enforcing the terms of our contracts, including litigation. Such collection\\nfailure and enforcement costs, along with any costs associated with a failure to comply with applicable rules and regulations, could, in the aggregate, impact our\\nfinancial performance.\\nLoss or material modification of our credit card acceptance privileges could have an adverse effect on our business and operating results.\\nIn 2022, 72% of our Gross Bookings were paid by either credit card or debit card. As such, the loss of our credit card acceptance privileges would significantly\\nlimit our business model. We are required by our payment processors to comply with payment card network operating rules, including the Payment Card Industry\\n(“PCI”) and Data Security Standard (the “Standard”). The Standard is a comprehensive set of requirements for enhancing payment account data security developed\\nby the PCI Security Standards Council to help facilitate the broad adoption of consistent data security measures. Our failure to comply with the Standard and other\\nnetwork operating rules could result in fines or restrictions on our ability to accept payment cards. Under certain circumstances specified in the payment card\\nnetwork rules, we may be required to submit to periodic audits, self-assessments, or other assessments of our compliance with the Standard. Such activities may\\nreveal that we have failed to comply with the Standard. If an audit, self- assessment, or other test determines that we need to take steps to remediate any\\ndeficiencies, such remediation efforts may distract our management team and require us to undertake costly and time consuming remediation efforts. In addition,\\neven if we comply with the Standard, there is no assurance that we will be protected from a security breach. Moreover, the payment card networks could adopt new\\noperating rules or interpret existing rules that we or our processors might find difficult or even impossible to follow, or costly to implement. In addition to\\nviolations of network rules, including the Standard, any failure to maintain good relationships with the payment card networks could impact our ability to receive\\nincentives from them, could increase our costs, or could otherwise harm our business. The loss of our credit card acceptance privileges for any one of these reasons,\\nor the significant modification of the terms under which we obtain credit card acceptance privileges, may have an adverse effect on our business, revenue, and\\noperating results.\\n26\\nOur platform is highly technical, and any undetected errors could adversely affect our business.\\nOur platform is a complex system composed of many interoperating components and incorporates software that is highly complex. Our business is dependent\\nupon our ability to prevent system interruption on our platform. Our software, including open source software that is incorporated into our code, may now or in the\\nfuture contain undetected errors, bugs, or vulnerabilities. Some errors in our software code may only be discovered after the code has been released. Bugs in our\\nsoftware, third-party software including open source software that is incorporated into our code, misconfigurations of our systems, and unintended interactions\\nbetween systems could result in our failure to comply with certain federal, state, or foreign reporting obligations, or could cause downtime that would impact the\\navailability of our service to platform users. We have from time to time found defects or errors in our system and may discover additional defects in the future that\\ncould result in platform unavailability or system disruption. In addition, we have experienced outages on our platform due to circumstances within our control, such\\nas outages due to software limitations. We rely on co-located data centers for the operation of our platform. If our co-located data centers fail, our platform users\\nmay experience down time. If sustained or repeated, any of these outages could reduce the attractiveness of our platform to platform users. In addition, our release\\nof new software in the past has inadvertently caused, and may in the future cause, interruptions in the availability or functionality of our platform. Any errors, bugs,\\nor vulnerabilities discovered in our code or systems after release could result in an interruption in the availability of our platform or a negative experience for\\nDrivers, consumers, merchants, Shippers, and Carriers, and could also result in negative publicity and unfavorable media coverage, damage to our reputation, loss\\nof platform users, loss of revenue or liability for damages, regulatory inquiries, or other proceedings, any of which could adversely affect our business and financial\\nresults. In addition, our growing use of artificial intelligence (“AI”) (including machine learning) in our offerings presents additional risks. AI algorithms or\\nautomated processing of data may be flawed and datasets may be insufficient or contain biased information. Inappropriate or controversial data practices by us or\\nothers could impair the acceptance of AI solutions or subject us to lawsuits and regulatory investigations. These deficiencies could undermine the decisions,\\npredictions or analysis AI applications produce, or lead to unintentional bias and discrimination, subjecting us to competitive harm, legal liability, and brand or\\nreputational harm.\\nWe are subject to climate change risks, including physical and transitional risks, and if we are unable to manage such risks, our business may be adversely\\nimpacted.\\nWe face climate change related physical and transition risks, which include the risk of market shifts toward electric vehicles (“EVs”) and lower carbon\\nbusiness models and risks related to extreme weather events or natural disasters. Climate-related events, including the increasing frequency, severity and duration\\nof extreme weather events and their impact on critical infrastructure in the United States and elsewhere, have the potential to disrupt our business, our third-party\\nsuppliers, and the business of merchants, Shippers, Carriers and Drivers using our platform, and may cause us to experience higher losses and additional costs to\\nmaintain or resume operations. Additionally, we are subject to emerging climate policies such as a regulation adopted in California in May 2021 requiring 90% of\\nvehicle miles traveled by rideshare fleets in California to have been in zero emission vehicles by 2030, with interim targets beginning in 2023. In addition, Drivers\\nmay be subject to climate-related policies that indirectly impact our business, such as the Congestion Charge Zone and Ultra Low Emission Zone schemes adopted\\nin London that impose fees on drivers in fossil-fueled vehicles, which may impact our ability to attract and maintain Drivers on our platform, and to the extent we\\nexperience Driver supply constraints in a given market, we may need to increase Driver incentives.\\nWe have made climate related commitments that require us to invest significant effort, resources, and management time, and circumstances may arise,\\nincluding those beyond our control, that may require us to revise the contemplated timeframes for implementing these commitments.\\nWe have made climate related commitments, including our commitment to 100% renewable electricity for our U.S. offices by 2025, our commitment to net\\nzero climate emissions from corporate operations by 2030, and our commitment to be a net zero company by 2040. In addition, our Supplier Code of Conduct sets\\nenvironmental standards for our supply chain, and we recognize that there are inherent climate-related risks wherever business is conducted. Progressing towards\\nour climate commitments requires us to invest significant effort, resources, and management time, and circumstances may arise, including those beyond our\\ncontrol, that may require us to revise our timelines and/or climate commitments. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted our ability to\\ndedicate resources to make the progress on our climate commitments that we initially anticipated. In addition, our ability to meet our climate commitments is\\ndependent on external factors such as rapidly changing regulations, policies and related interpretation, advances in technology such as battery storage, as well the\\navailability, cost and accessibility of EVs to Drivers, and the availability of EV charging infrastructure that can be efficiently accessed by Drivers. Any failure to\\nmeet regulatory requirements related to climate change, or to meet our stated climate change commitments on the timeframe we committed to, or at all, could have\\nan adverse impact on our costs and ability to operate, as well as harm our brand, reputation, and consequently, our business.\\nGeneral Economic Risks\\nOutbreaks of contagious disease and the impact of actions to mitigate the such disease or pandemic, have adversely impacted and could in the future adversely\\nimpact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\\n27\\nOccurrence of a catastrophic event, including but not limited to disease, a weather event, war, or terrorist attack, could adversely impact our business, financial\\ncondition and results of operation. We also face risks related to health epidemics, outbreaks of contagious disease, and other adverse health developments. For\\nexample, the COVID-19 pandemic and responses to had an adverse impact on our business and operations, including, for example, by reducing the demand for our\\nMobility offerings globally, and affecting travel behavior and demand, as well as impacting Driver supply constraints. As another example, during the COVID-19\\npandemic, to support social distancing, we temporarily suspended our shared rides offering globally.\\nThe extent of the impact of any future pandemic or outbreak of disease, on our business and financial results will depend largely on future developments,\\nincluding the duration of the spread of the outbreak and any future “waves” or resurgences of the outbreak or variants of the virus, both globally and within the\\nUnited States, the administration, adoption and efficacy of vaccines in the United States and internationally, the impact on capital and financial markets, the impact\\non global supply chains, foreign currencies exchange, governmental or regulatory orders that impact our business and whether the impacts may result in permanent\\nchanges to our end-users’ behaviors, all of which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted.\\nIn addition, we cannot predict the impact any future pandemic or outbreak of a disease, or a catastrophic event will have on our business partners and third-\\nparty vendors, and we may be adversely impacted as a result of the adverse impact our business partners and third-party vendors suffer. For example, concerns over\\nthe economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic caused extreme volatility in financial markets, which adversely impacted our stock price and our ability to access\\ncapital markets, and any future pandemics or other catastrophic events may have a similar impact. To the extent a pandemic or other catastrophic event adversely\\naffects our business and financial results, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this “Risk Factors” section. Any of the\\nforegoing factors, or other cascading effects of the pandemic that are not currently foreseeable, could adversely impact our business, financial performance and\\ncondition, and results of operations.\\nThe impact of economic conditions, including the resulting effect on discretionary consumer spending, may harm our business and operating results.\\nOur performance is subject to economic conditions and their impact on levels of discretionary consumer spending. Some of the factors that have an impact on\\ndiscretionary consumer spending include general economic conditions, unemployment, consumer debt, reductions in net worth, residential real estate and mortgage\\nmarkets, taxation, energy prices, interest rates, consumer confidence, and other macroeconomic factors. A deterioration of general macroeconomic conditions,\\nincluding slower growth or recession, inflation and higher interest rates, or decreases in consumer spending power may harm our results of operations. For\\nexample, inflation has increased and is expected to increase our insurance costs. Consumer preferences tend to shift to lower-cost alternatives during recessionary\\nperiods and other periods in which disposable income is adversely affected. In such circumstances, consumers may choose to use one of our lower price-point\\nproducts over a higher Gross Bookings per Trip offering, may choose to forgo our offerings for lower-cost personal vehicle or public transportation alternatives, or\\nmay reduce total miles traveled as economic activity decreases. Such a shift in consumer behavior may reduce our network liquidity and may harm our business,\\nfinancial condition, and operating results. Likewise, small businesses that do not have substantial resources, including many of the merchants in our network, tend\\nto be more adversely affected by poor economic conditions than large businesses. Further, because spending for food purchases from merchants is generally\\nconsidered discretionary, any decline in consumer spending may have a disproportionate effect on our Delivery offering. If spending at many of the merchants in\\nour network declines, or if a significant number of these merchants go out of business, consumers may be less likely to use our products and offerings, which could\\nharm our business and operating results. Alternatively, if economic conditions improve, it could lead to Drivers obtaining additional or alternative opportunities for\\nwork, which could negatively impact the number of Drivers on our platform, and thereby reduce our network liquidity.\\nIncreases in fuel, food, labor, energy, and other costs due to inflation and other factors could adversely affect our operating results.\\nFactors such as inflation, increased fuel prices, and increased vehicle purchase, rental, or maintenance costs, including increased prices of new and used\\nvehicle parts as a result of recent global supply chain challenges, and increased fuel prices as result of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, have and may\\ncontinue to increase the costs incurred by Drivers and Carriers when providing services on our platform. Similarly, factors such as inflation, increased food costs,\\nincreased labor and employee benefit costs, increased rental costs, and increased energy costs may increase merchant operating costs, particularly in certain\\ninternational markets, such as Egypt. Many of the factors affecting Driver, merchant, and Carrier costs are beyond the control of these parties. In many cases, these\\nincreased costs may cause Drivers and Carriers to spend less time providing services on our platform or to seek alternative sources of income. Likewise, these\\nincreased costs may cause merchants to pass costs on to consumers by increasing prices, which would likely cause order volume to decline, may cause merchants\\nto cease operations altogether, or may cause Carriers to pass costs on to Shippers, which may cause shipments on our platform to decline. A decreased supply of\\nDrivers, consumers, merchants, Shippers, or Carriers on our platform would decrease our network liquidity, which could harm our business and operating results.\\nDependencies on Third Parties\\nThe successful operation of our business depends upon the performance and reliability of Internet, mobile, and other infrastructures that are not under our\\ncontrol.\\n28\\nOur business depends on the performance and reliability of Internet, mobile, and other infrastructures that are not under our control. Disruptions in Internet\\ninfrastructure or GPS signals or the failure of telecommunications network operators to provide us with the bandwidth we need to provide our products and\\nofferings have interfered, and could continue to interfere with the speed and availability of our platform. If our platform is unavailable when platform users attempt\\nto access it, or if our platform does not load as quickly as platform users expect, platform users may not return to our platform as often in the future, or at all, and\\nmay use our competitors’ products or offerings more often. In addition, we have no control over the costs of the services provided by national telecommunications\\noperators. If mobile Internet access fees or other charges to Internet users increase, consumer traffic may decrease, which may in turn cause our revenue to\\nsignificantly decrease.\\nOur business depends on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of mobile communications systems. The occurrence of an unanticipated problem, such as a\\npower outage, telecommunications delay or failure, security breach, or computer virus could result in delays or interruptions to our products, offerings, and\\nplatform, as well as business interruptions for us and platform users. Furthermore, foreign governments may leverage their ability to shut down directed services,\\nand local governments may shut down our platform at the routing level. Any of these events could damage our reputation, significantly disrupt our operations, and\\nsubject us to liability, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results. We have invested significant resources to develop new\\nproducts to mitigate the impact of potential interruptions to mobile communications systems, which can be used by consumers in territories where mobile\\ncommunications systems are less efficient. However, these products may ultimately be unsuccessful.\\nWe rely on third parties maintaining open marketplaces to distribute our platform and to provide the software we use in certain of our products and offerings.\\nIf such third parties interfere with the distribution of our products or offerings or with our use of such software, our business would be adversely affected.\\nOur platform relies on third parties maintaining open marketplaces, including the Apple App Store and Google Play, which make applications available for\\ndownload. We cannot assure you that the marketplaces through which we distribute our platform will maintain their current structures or that such marketplaces\\nwill not charge us fees to list our applications for download. For example, Apple Inc. requires that iOS apps obtain users’ permission to track their activities across\\nthird-party apps and websites. If iOS users do not grant us such permission, our ability to target those users for advertisements and to measure the effectiveness of\\nsuch advertisements may be adversely affected, which could decrease the effectiveness of our advertising, and increase our costs to acquire and engage users on our\\nplatform. We rely upon certain third parties to provide software for our products and offerings, including Google Maps for the mapping function that is critical to\\nthe functionality of our platform. We do not believe that an alternative mapping solution exists that can provide the global functionality that we require to offer our\\nplatform in all of the markets in which we operate. We do not control all mapping functions employed by our platform or Drivers using our platform, and it is\\npossible that such mapping functions may not be reliable. If such third parties cease to provide access to the third-party software that we and Drivers use, do not\\nprovide access to such software on terms that we believe to be attractive or reasonable, or do not provide us with the most current version of such software, we may\\nbe required to seek comparable software from other sources, which may be more expensive or inferior, or may not be available at all, any of which would adversely\\naffect our business.\\nOur business depends upon the interoperability of our platform across devices, operating systems, and third-party applications that we do not control.\\nOne of the most important features of our platform is its broad interoperability with a range of devices, operating systems, and third-party applications. Our\\nplatform is accessible from the web and from devices running various operating systems such as iOS and Android. We depend on the accessibility of our platform\\nacross these third-party operating systems and applications that we do not control. Moreover, third-party services and products are constantly evolving, and we may\\nnot be able to modify our platform to assure its compatibility with that of other third parties following development changes. The loss of interoperability, whether\\ndue to actions of third parties or otherwise, could adversely affect our business.\\nWe rely on third parties for elements of the payment processing infrastructure underlying our platform. If these third-party elements become unavailable or\\nunavailable on favorable terms, our business could be adversely affected.\\nThe convenient payment mechanisms provided by our platform are key factors contributing to the development of our business. We rely on third parties for\\nelements of our payment-processing infrastructure to remit payments to Drivers, merchants, and Carriers using our platform, and these third parties may refuse to\\nrenew our agreements with them on commercially reasonable terms or at all. If these companies become unwilling or unable to provide these services to us on\\nacceptable terms or at all, our business may be disrupted. For certain payment methods, including credit and debit cards, we generally pay interchange fees and\\nother processing and gateway fees, and such fees result in significant costs. In addition, online payment providers are under continued pressure to pay increased\\nfees to banks to process funds, and there is no assurance that such online payment providers will not pass any increased costs on to merchant partners, including us.\\nIf these fees increase over time, our operating costs will increase, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results.\\nIn addition, system failures have at times prevented us from making payments to Drivers in accordance with our typical timelines and processes, and have\\ncaused substantial Driver dissatisfaction and generated a significant number of Driver complaints. Future failures of the payment processing infrastructure\\nunderlying our platform could cause Drivers to lose trust in our payment operations\\n29\\nand could cause them to instead use our competitors’ platforms. If the quality or convenience of our payment processing infrastructure declines as a result of these\\nlimitations or for any other reason, the attractiveness of our business to Drivers, merchants, and Carriers could be adversely affected. If we are forced to migrate to\\nother third-party payment service providers for any reason, the transition would require significant time and management resources, and may not be as effective,\\nefficient, or well-received by platform users.\\nWe currently rely on a small number of third-party service providers to host a significant portion of our platform, and any interruptions or delays in services\\nfrom these third parties could impair the delivery of our products and offerings and harm our business.\\nWe use a combination of third-party cloud computing services and co-located data centers in the United States and abroad. We do not control the physical\\noperation of any of the co-located data centers we use or the operations of our third-party service providers. These third-party operations and co-located data\\ncenters may experience break-ins, computer viruses, denial-of-service attacks, sabotage, acts of vandalism, and other misconduct. These facilities may also be\\nvulnerable to damage or interruption from power loss, telecommunications failures, fires, floods, earthquakes, hurricanes, tornadoes, and similar events. Our\\nsystems do not provide complete redundancy of data storage or processing, and as a result, the occurrence of any such event, a decision by our third-party service\\nproviders to close our co-located data centers without adequate notice, or other unanticipated problems may result in our inability to serve data reliably or require\\nus to migrate our data to either a new on-premise data center or cloud computing service. This could be time consuming and costly and may result in the loss of\\ndata, any of which could significantly interrupt the provision of our products and offerings and harm our reputation and brand. We may not be able to easily switch\\nto another cloud or data center provider in the event of any disruptions or interference to the services we use, and even if we do, other cloud and data center\\nproviders are subject to the same risks. Additionally, our co-located data center facility agreements are of limited durations, and our co-located data center facilities\\nhave no obligation to renew their agreements with us on commercially reasonable terms or at all. If we are unable to renew our agreements with these facilities on\\ncommercially reasonable terms, we may experience delays in the provision of our products and offerings until an agreement with another co-located data center is\\narranged. Interruptions in the delivery of our products and offerings may reduce our revenue, cause Drivers, merchants, and Carriers to stop offering their services\\nthrough our platform, and reduce use of our platform by consumers and Shippers. Our business and operating results may be harmed if current and potential\\nDrivers, consumers, merchants, Shippers, and Carriers believe our platform is unreliable. In addition, if we are unable to scale our data storage and computational\\ncapacity sufficiently or on commercially reasonable terms, our ability to innovate and introduce new products on our platform may be delayed or compromised,\\nwhich would have an adverse effect on our growth and business.\\nOur use of third-party open source software could adversely affect our ability to offer our products and offerings and subjects us to possible litigation.\\nWe use third-party open source software in connection with the development of our platform. From time to time, companies that use third-party open source\\nsoftware have faced claims challenging the use of such open source software and their compliance with the terms of the applicable open source license. We may be\\nsubject to suits by parties claiming ownership of what we believe to be open source software, or claiming non-compliance with the applicable open source licensing\\nterms. Some open source licenses require end-users who distribute or make available across a network software and services that include open source software to\\nmake available all or part of such software, which in some circumstances could include valuable proprietary code. While we employ practices designed to monitor\\nour compliance with the licenses of third-party open source software and protect our valuable proprietary source code, we have not run a complete open source\\nlicense review and may inadvertently use third-party open source software in a manner that exposes us to claims of non-compliance with the applicable terms of\\nsuch license, including claims for infringement of intellectual property rights or for breach of contract. Furthermore, there is an increasing number of open-source\\nsoftware license types, almost none of which have been tested in a court of law, resulting in a dearth of guidance regarding the proper legal interpretation of such\\nlicenses. If we were to receive a claim of non-compliance with the terms of any of our open source licenses, we may be required to publicly release certain portions\\nof our proprietary source code or expend substantial time and resources to re-engineer some or all of our software.\\nIn addition, the use of third-party open source software typically exposes us to greater risks than the use of third-party commercial software because open-\\nsource licensors generally do not provide warranties or controls on the functionality or origin of the software. Use of open source software may also present\\nadditional security risks because the public availability of such software may make it easier for hackers and other third parties to determine how to compromise our\\nplatform. Additionally, because any software source code that we make available under an open source license or that we contribute to existing open source projects\\nbecomes publicly available, our ability to protect our intellectual property rights in such software source code may be limited or lost entirely, and we would be\\nunable to prevent our competitors or others from using such contributed software source code. Any of the foregoing could be harmful to our business, financial\\ncondition, or operating results and could help our competitors develop products and offerings that are similar to or better than ours.\\nFinancing and Transactional Risks\\nWe will require additional capital to support the growth of our business, and this capital might not be available on reasonable terms or at all.\\nTo continue to effectively compete, we will require additional funds to support the growth of our business and allow us to invest\\n30\\nin new products, offerings, and markets. If we raise additional funds through further issuances of equity or convertible debt securities, our existing stockholders\\nmay suffer significant dilution, and any new equity securities we issue may have rights, preferences, and privileges superior to those of existing stockholders.\\nCertain of our existing debt instruments contain, and any debt financing we secure in the future could contain, restrictive covenants relating to our ability to incur\\nadditional indebtedness and other financial and operational matters that make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital with which to pursue business\\nopportunities. For example, our existing debt instruments contain significant restrictions on our ability to incur additional secured indebtedness. We may not be able\\nto obtain additional financing on favorable terms, if at all. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us when required, our\\nability to continue to support our business growth and to respond to business challenges and competition may be significantly limited.\\nWe have incurred a significant amount of debt and may in the future incur additional indebtedness. Our payment obligations under such indebtedness may\\nlimit the funds available to us, and the terms of our debt agreements may restrict our flexibility in operating our business.\\nAs of December\\xa031, 2022, we had total outstanding indebtedness of $9.4\\xa0billion aggregate principal amount. In addition, up to approximately $152 million of\\nCareem Convertible Notes remain subject to future issuance to Careem stockholders as of December\\xa031, 2022. Subject to the limitations in the terms of our existing\\nand future indebtedness, we and our subsidiaries may incur additional debt, secure existing or future debt, or refinance our debt. In particular, we may need to incur\\nadditional debt to finance the purchase of autonomous vehicles, and such financing may not be available to us on attractive terms or at all.\\nWe may be required to use a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to pay interest and principal on our indebtedness. Such payments will reduce\\nthe funds available to us for working capital, capital expenditures, and other corporate purposes and limit our ability to obtain additional financing for working\\ncapital, capital expenditures, expansion plans, and other investments, which may in turn limit our ability to implement our business strategy, heighten our\\nvulnerability to downturns in our business, the industry, or in the general economy, limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and\\nthe industry, and prevent us from taking advantage of business opportunities as they arise. We cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow\\nfrom operations or that future financing will be available to us in amounts sufficient to enable us to make required and timely payments on our indebtedness, or to\\nfund our operations. To date, we have used a substantial amount of cash for operating activities, and we cannot assure you when we will begin to generate cash\\nfrom operating activities in amounts sufficient to cover our debt service obligations.\\nIn addition, under certain of our existing debt instruments, we and certain of our subsidiaries are subject to limitations regarding our business and operations,\\nincluding limitations on incurring additional indebtedness and liens, limitations on certain consolidations, mergers, and sales of assets, and restrictions on the\\npayment of dividends or distributions. Any debt financing secured by us in the future could involve additional restrictive covenants relating to our capital-raising\\nactivities and other financial and operational matters, which may make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital to pursue business opportunities,\\nincluding potential acquisitions or divestitures. Any default under our debt arrangements could require that we repay our loans immediately, and may limit our\\nability to obtain additional financing, which in turn may have an adverse effect on our cash flows and liquidity.\\nIn addition, we are exposed to interest rate risk related to some of our indebtedness, which is discussed in greater detail under the section titled “Management\\'s\\nDiscussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk - Interest Rate Risk.”\\nWe may have exposure to materially greater than anticipated tax liabilities.\\nThe tax laws applicable to our global business activities are subject to uncertainty and can be interpreted differently by different companies. For example, we\\nmay become subject to sales tax rates in certain jurisdictions that are significantly greater than the rates we currently pay in those jurisdictions. Like many other\\nmultinational corporations, we are subject to tax in multiple U.S. and foreign jurisdictions and have structured our operations to reduce our effective tax rate.\\nCurrently, certain jurisdictions are investigating our compliance with tax rules. If it is determined that we are not compliant with such rules, we could owe\\nadditional taxes.\\nCertain jurisdictions, including Australia, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, the UK and other countries, require that we pay any assessed taxes prior to being allowed\\nto contest or litigate the applicability of tax assessments in those jurisdictions. These amounts could materially adversely impact our liquidity while those matters\\nare being litigated. This prepayment of contested taxes is referred to as “pay-to-play.” Payment of these amounts is not an admission that we believe we are subject\\nto such taxes; even when such payments are made, we continue to defend our positions vigorously. If we prevail in the proceedings for which a pay-to-play\\npayment was made, the jurisdiction collecting the payment will be required to repay such amounts and also may be required to pay interest.\\nAdditionally, the taxing authorities of the jurisdictions in which we operate have in the past, and may in the future, examine or challenge our methodologies for\\nvaluing developed technology, which could increase our worldwide effective tax rate and harm our financial position and operating results. Furthermore, our future\\nincome taxes could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions that have lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in\\njurisdictions that have higher statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation allowance on our U.S. and Netherlands\\' deferred tax assets, or changes in tax laws,\\nregulations, or accounting principles. We are subject to regular review and audit by both U.S. federal and state tax authorities, as well\\n31\\nas foreign tax authorities, and currently face numerous audits in the United States and abroad. Any adverse outcome of such reviews and audits could have an\\nadverse effect on our financial position and operating results. In addition, the determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities\\nrequires significant judgment by our management, and we have engaged in many transactions for which the ultimate tax determination remains uncertain. The\\nultimate tax outcome may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements and may materially affect our financial results in the period or periods for\\nwhich such determination is made. Our tax positions or tax returns are subject to change, and therefore we cannot accurately predict whether we may incur material\\nadditional tax liabilities in the future, which could impact our financial position. In addition, in connection with any planned or future acquisitions, we may acquire\\nbusinesses that have differing licenses and other arrangements that may be challenged by tax authorities for not being at arm’s-length or that are otherwise\\npotentially less tax efficient than our licenses and arrangements. Any subsequent integration or continued operation of such acquired businesses may result in an\\nincreased effective tax rate in certain jurisdictions or potential indirect tax costs, which could result in us incurring additional tax liabilities or having to establish a\\nreserve in our consolidated financial statements, and could adversely affect our financial results.\\nChanges in global and U.S. tax legislation may adversely affect our financial condition, operating results, and cash flows.\\nWe are a U.S.-based multinational company subject to tax in multiple U.S. and foreign tax jurisdictions. Beginning on January 1, 2022, the Tax Cuts and Jobs\\nAct (“the Act”), enacted in December 2017, eliminated the option to deduct research and development expenditures in the current period and requires taxpayers to\\ncapitalize and amortize U.S.-based and non-U.S. based research and development expenditures over five and fifteen years, respectively. This legislation has\\naccelerated the utilization of our net operating losses in the U.S., but it has not impacted our current tax obligations.\\nIn August 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act (“the IRA”) was enacted to take into effect for tax years after December 31, 2022. It introduced a corporate\\nalternative minimum tax (“CAMT”) equal to 15% of the adjusted financial statement income for large corporations with profits in excess of $1 billion and a 1%\\nexcise tax on certain share buybacks by public corporations that would be imposed on such corporations. While pending further guidance, it is possible that the\\nIRA could increase our future tax liability, which could in turn adversely impact our business and future profitability.\\nWe are unable to predict what global or U.S. tax reforms may be proposed or enacted in the future or what effects such future changes would have on our\\nbusiness. Any such changes in tax legislation, regulations, policies or practices in the jurisdictions in which we operate could increase the estimated tax liability that\\nwe have expensed to date and paid or accrued on our balance sheet; affect our financial position, future operating results, cash flows, and effective tax rates where\\nwe have operations; reduce post-tax returns to our stockholders; and increase the complexity, burden, and cost of tax compliance. We are subject to potential\\nchanges in relevant tax, accounting, and other laws, regulations, and interpretations, including changes to tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals. We could\\nbecome subject to digital services taxes in one or more jurisdictions where we operate. The governments of countries in which we operate and other governmental\\nbodies could make unprecedented assertions about how taxation is determined in their jurisdictions that are contrary to the way in which we have interpreted and\\nhistorically applied the rules and regulations described above in our income tax returns filed in such jurisdictions. New laws could significantly increase our tax\\nobligations in the countries in which we do business or require us to change the manner in which we operate our business. As a result of the large and expanding\\nscale of our international business activities, many of these changes to the taxation of our activities could increase our worldwide effective tax rate and harm our\\nfinancial position, operating results, and cash flows.\\nOur ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited.\\nAs of December 31, 2022, we had U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards of $1.9 billion that begin to expire in 2031 and $12.1 billion that have an\\nunlimited carryover period. As of December 31, 2022, we had U.S. state net operating loss carryforwards of $9.4 billion that started expiring in 2022 and $2.0\\nbillion that have an unlimited carryover period. As of December 31, 2022, we had foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $633 million that begin to expire in\\n2023 and $17.7 billion that have an unlimited carryover period. Realization of these net operating loss carryforwards depends on our future taxable income, and\\nthere is a risk that our existing carryforwards could expire unused and be unavailable to offset future income tax liabilities, which could materially and adversely\\naffect our operating results. In addition, under Sections 382 and 383 of the IRC, if a corporation undergoes an “ownership change,” generally defined as a greater\\nthan 50% change (by value) in its equity ownership over a three-year period, the corporation’s ability to use its pre-ownership change U.S. federal net operating\\nloss carryforwards and other pre-ownership change U.S. federal tax attributes, such as research tax credits, to offset its post-ownership change income may be\\nlimited. Many U.S. states follow similar rules for restricting use of tax attributes after an ownership change. We may experience ownership changes in the future\\nbecause of subsequent shifts in our stock ownership. As a result, if we earn net taxable income, our ability to use our pre-ownership change net operating loss\\ncarryforwards and other tax attributes to offset U.S. federal and state taxable income may be subject to limitations, which could potentially result in increased\\nfuture tax liability to us.\\nWe are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates.\\nBecause we conduct a significant and may conduct a growing portion of our business in currencies other than the U.S. dollar but report our consolidated\\nfinancial results in U.S. dollars, we face exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. As exchange rates vary, revenue, cost of revenue, exclusive of\\ndepreciation and amortization, operating expenses, other income and expense, and assets and liabilities, when translated, may also vary materially and thus affect\\nour overall financial results. We have not to date, but\\n32\\nmay in the future, enter into hedging arrangements to manage foreign currency translation, but such activity may not completely eliminate fluctuations in our\\noperating results due to currency exchange rate changes. Hedging arrangements are inherently risky, and we have limited experience establishing hedging\\nprograms, which could expose us to additional risks that could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.\\nIf we are unable to successfully identify, acquire and integrate suitable businesses, our operating results and prospects could be harmed, and any businesses we\\nacquire may not perform as expected or be effectively integrated.\\nAs part of our business strategy, we have entered into, and expect to continue to enter into, agreements to acquire companies, form joint ventures, divest\\nportions or aspects of our business, sell minority stakes in portions or aspects of our business, and acquire complementary companies or technologies. Competition\\nwithin our industry for acquisitions of businesses, technologies, and assets is intense. As such, even if we are able to identify a target for acquisition, we may not be\\nable to complete the acquisition on commercially reasonable terms, we may not be able to receive approval from the applicable competition authorities, or such\\ntarget may be acquired by another company, including one of our competitors.\\nFurther, negotiations for potential acquisitions or other transactions may result in the diversion of our management’s time and significant out-of-pocket costs.\\nWe may expend significant cash or incur substantial debt to finance such acquisitions, and such indebtedness may restrict our business or require the use of\\navailable cash to make interest and principal payments. In addition, we may finance or otherwise complete acquisitions by issuing equity or convertible debt\\nsecurities, which may result in dilution to our stockholders, or if such convertible debt securities are not converted, significant cash outlays. If we fail to evaluate\\nand execute acquisitions or other strategic transactions successfully or fail to successfully address any of these risks, our business, financial condition, and\\noperating results may be harmed.\\nIn addition, any businesses we acquire may not perform as well as we expect. Failure to manage and successfully integrate acquired businesses and\\ntechnologies, including managing internal controls and any privacy or data security risks associated with such acquisitions, may harm our operating results and\\nexpansion prospects. For example, Careem has historically shared certain user data with certain government authorities, which conflicts with our global policies\\nregarding data use, sharing, and ownership. We have maintained our data use, sharing, and ownership practices for both our business and Careem’s business, and\\ndoing so may cause our relationships with government authorities in certain jurisdictions to suffer, and may result in such government authorities assessing\\nsignificant fines or penalties against us or shutting down our or Careem’s app on either a temporary or indefinite basis. The process of integrating an acquired\\ncompany, business, or technology or acquired personnel into our company is subject to various risks and challenges, including:\\n•\\ndiverting management time and focus from operating our business to acquisition integration;\\n•\\ndisrupting our ongoing business operations;\\n•\\nplatform user acceptance of the acquired company’s offerings;\\n•\\nimplementing or remediating the controls, procedures, and policies of the acquired company;\\n•\\nintegrating the acquired business onto our systems and ensuring the acquired business meets our financial reporting requirements and timelines;\\n•\\nretaining and integrating acquired employees, including aligning incentives between acquired employees and existing employees, managing cultural\\ndifferences between acquired businesses and our business, as well as managing costs associated with eliminating redundancies or transferring\\nemployees on acceptable terms with minimal business disruption;\\n•\\nmaintaining important business relationships and contracts of the acquired business;\\n•\\nintegrating the brand identity of an acquired company with our own;\\n•\\nintegrating companies that have significant operations or that develop products where we do not have prior experience;\\n•\\nliability for pre-acquisition activities of the acquired company;\\n•\\nlitigation or other claims or liabilities arising in connection with the acquisition or the acquired company; and\\n•\\nimpairment charges associated with goodwill, long-lived assets, investments, and other acquired intangible assets.\\nWe have in the past and may in the future implement integration structures that do not fully integrate an acquired company’s operating functions. For example,\\nwith respect to the integration of Careem and Drizly, each company’s brand, product app(s) and payments apps continue to operate in parallel with Uber’s apps and\\neach company’s engineering, human resources, and operations teams will continue to operate independently and report to such company’s own Chief Executive\\nOfficer. Such structures may delay the efficiencies that we expect to gain from the acquisition and our brand and reputation could be impacted by any damage or\\nreputational harm to the acquired company’s brand.\\nIn addition, our acquisition of Careem has increased our risks under the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”) and other similar laws outside the United\\nStates. Our existing and planned safeguards, including training and compliance programs to discourage\\n33\\ncorrupt practices by such parties, may not prove effective, and such parties may engage in conduct for which we could be held responsible.\\nWe may not receive a favorable return on investment for prior or future business combinations, and we cannot predict whether these transactions will be\\naccretive to the value of our common stock. It is also possible that acquisitions, combinations, divestitures, joint ventures, or other strategic transactions we\\nannounce could be viewed negatively by the press, investors, platform users, or regulators, any or all of which may adversely affect our reputation and our\\nbusiness. Any of these factors may adversely affect our ability to consummate a transaction, our financial condition, and our operating results.\\nLegal and Regulatory Risks Related to Our Business\\nWe may continue to be blocked from or limited in providing or operating our products and offerings in certain jurisdictions, and may be required to modify our\\nbusiness model in those jurisdictions as a result.\\nIn certain jurisdictions, including expansion markets such as Argentina, Germany, Italy, Japan, South Korea, and Spain, our ridesharing business model has\\nbeen blocked, capped, or suspended, or we have been required to change our business model, due primarily to laws and significant regulatory restrictions in such\\njurisdictions. In some cases, we have applied for and obtained licenses or permits to operate and must continue to comply with the license or permit requirements\\nor risk revocation. In addition, we may not be able to maintain or renew any such license or permit. We cannot predict whether future regulatory decisions or\\nlegislation in other jurisdictions may embolden or encourage other authorities to take similar actions even where we are operating according to the terms of an\\nexisting license or permit.\\nTraditional taxicab and car service operators in various jurisdictions continue to lobby legislators and regulators to block our Mobility products or to require us\\nto comply with regulatory, insurance, record-keeping, licensing, and other requirements to which taxicab and car services are subject. For example, in January\\n2019, we suspended our Mobility products in Barcelona after the regional government enacted regulations mandating minimum wait times before riders could be\\npicked up by ridesharing drivers; in March 2021, we returned to Barcelona via taxis only. In December 2018, New York City’s Taxi and Limousine Commission\\nimplemented a per-mile and per-minute minimum trip payment formula, designed to establish a minimum pay standard, for drivers providing for-hire services in\\nNew York City, such as those provided by Drivers on our platform. These minimum rates took effect in February 2019. Since implementation, these regulations\\nhave had an adverse impact on our financial performance in New York City and may continue to do so in the future. In August 2018, the New York City Council\\nvoted to approve various measures to further regulate our business, including driver earning rules, licensing requirements, and a one-year freeze on new for-hire\\nvehicle licenses for ridesharing services like those enabled via our platform; the freeze on for-hire vehicle licenses remains. Additionally, in November 2019, a\\nballot measure to impose a surcharge on ridesharing trips in San Francisco was passed by voters in San Francisco and such surcharge took effect on January 1,\\n2020. Also in January 2020, a new tax went into effect in Chicago that imposes a surcharge of up to $3 per ridesharing trip taken in Chicago. In addition, in\\nOctober 2020, the Seattle City Council passed a minimum pay standard for drivers providing services on our platform that went into effect on January 1, 2021, and\\nother jurisdictions have in the past considered or may consider regulations which would implement minimum wage requirements or permit drivers to negotiate for\\nminimum wages while providing services on our platform. Similar legislative or regulatory initiatives are being considered or have been enacted in countries\\noutside the United States. If other jurisdictions impose similar regulations, our business growth could be adversely affected.\\nIn certain jurisdictions, we are subject to national, state, local, or municipal laws and regulations that are ambiguous in their application or enforcement or that\\nwe believe are invalid or inapplicable. In such jurisdictions, we may be subject to regulatory fines and proceedings and, in certain cases, may be required to cease\\noperations altogether if we continue to operate our business as currently conducted, unless and until such laws and regulations are reformed to clarify that our\\nbusiness operations are fully compliant. For example, in September 2020, the Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal issued a ruling against a group of drivers who used\\nthe Uber app, concluding that by driving for hire without a Hire Car Permit, they violated the local Road Traffic Ordinance. We are considering further legal\\nchallenges and possible policy solutions. However, these developments may adversely affect our ability to offer ridesharing services and negatively impact our\\nfinancial performance in Hong Kong. As another example, in January 2020, we ceased offering our Mobility products in Colombia after a Colombian court ruled\\nthat we violated local competition laws. In response, we appealed the decision, made certain changes to our Mobility products in Colombia and re-launched\\nMobility in Colombia in February 2020, and in June 2020, the Appeals Court of Bogota revoked its order to block Mobility products in Colombia. Furthermore, in\\ncertain of these jurisdictions, we continue to provide our products and offerings while we assess the applicability of these laws and regulations to our products and\\nofferings or while we seek regulatory or policy changes to address concerns with respect to our ability to comply with these laws and regulations. Our decision to\\ncontinue operating in these instances has come under investigation or has otherwise been subject to scrutiny by government authorities. Our continuation of this\\npractice and other past practices may result in fines or other penalties against us and Drivers imposed by local regulators, potentially increasing the risk that our\\nlicenses or permits that are necessary to operate in such jurisdictions will not be renewed. Such fines and penalties have in the past been, and may in the future\\ncontinue to be, imposed solely on Drivers, which may cause Drivers to stop providing services on our platform. In many instances, we make the business decision\\nas a gesture of goodwill to pay the fines on behalf of Drivers or to pay Drivers’ defense costs, which, in the aggregate, can be in the millions of dollars.\\nFurthermore, such business practices may also result in negative press coverage, which may discourage Drivers and consumers from using our platform and could\\nadversely affect our revenue. In addition, we face regulatory obstacles, including those lobbied for by our competitors or from local governments globally,\\n34\\nthat have favored and may continue to favor local or incumbent competitors, including obstacles for potential Drivers seeking to obtain required licenses or vehicle\\ncertifications. In addition, an increasing number of municipalities have proposed delivery network fee caps with respect to our Delivery offering and caps on surge\\npricing with respect to our Mobility offering. We have incurred, and expect that we will continue to incur, significant costs in defending our right to operate in\\naccordance with our business model in many jurisdictions. To the extent that efforts to block or limit our operations are successful, or we or Drivers are required to\\ncomply with regulatory and other requirements applicable to taxicab and car services, our revenue and growth would be adversely affected.\\nOur business is subject to numerous legal and regulatory risks that could have an adverse impact on our business and future prospects.\\nAs of December\\xa0 31, 2022, our platform is available in approximately 10,500 cities across approximately 70 countries. We are subject to differing, and\\nsometimes conflicting, laws and regulations in the various jurisdictions in which we provide our offerings. A large number of proposals are before various national,\\nregional, and local legislative bodies and regulatory entities, both within the United States and in foreign jurisdictions, regarding issues related to our business\\nmodel. Certain proposals, if adopted, could significantly and materially harm our business, financial condition, and operating results by restricting or limiting how\\nwe operate our business, increasing our operating costs, and decreasing our number of platform users. We cannot predict whether or when such proposals may be\\nadopted.\\nFurther, existing or new laws and regulations could expose us to substantial liability, including significant expenses necessary to comply with such laws and\\nregulations, and could dampen the growth and usage of our platform. For example, as we expand our offerings in new areas, such as non-emergency medical\\ntransportation, we may be subject to additional healthcare-related federal and state laws and regulations. Additionally, because our offerings are frequently first-to-\\nmarket in the jurisdictions in which we operate, several local jurisdictions have passed, and we expect additional jurisdictions to pass, laws and regulations that\\nlimit or block our ability to offer our products to Drivers and consumers in those jurisdictions, thereby impeding overall use of our platform. We are actively\\nchallenging some of these laws and regulations and are lobbying other jurisdictions to oppose similar restrictions on our business, especially our ridesharing\\nservices. Further, because a substantial portion of our business involves vehicles that run on fossil fuels, laws, regulations, or governmental actions seeking to curb\\nair pollution or emissions may impact our business. For example, in response to London’s efforts to cut emissions and improve air quality in the city (including the\\ninstitution of a toxicity charge for polluting vehicles in the city center congestion zone and the introduction of an “Ultra Low Emissions Zone” that went into effect\\nin April 2019), we have added a clean-air fee of 15 pence per mile to each trip on our platform in London, and plan to help Drivers on our platform fully transition\\nto electric vehicles by 2025. Moreover, in May 2021, California adopted a regulation requiring 90% of vehicle miles traveled by rideshare fleets in California to\\nhave been in EVs by 2030, with interim targets beginning in 2023. Additionally, proposed ridesharing regulations in Egypt and other jurisdictions may require us to\\nshare certain personal data with government authorities to operate our app, which we may not be willing to provide. Our failure to share such data in accordance\\nwith these regulations may result in government authorities assessing significant fines or penalties against us or shutting down our or Careem’s app in Egypt on\\neither a temporary or indefinite basis.\\nIn addition, we are currently involved in litigation in a number of the jurisdictions in which we operate. We initiated some of these legal challenges to contest\\nthe application of certain laws and regulations to our business. Others have been brought by taxicab owners, local regulators, local law enforcement, and platform\\nusers, including Drivers and consumers. These include individual, multiple plaintiff, and putative class and class action claims for alleged violation of laws related\\nto, among other things, transportation, competition, advertising, consumer protection, fee calculations, personal injuries, privacy, intellectual property, product\\nliability, discrimination, safety, and employment. For example, in May 2019, a class action was filed against us and certain of our subsidiaries in the Supreme Court\\nof Victoria, Australia on behalf of participants in the taxi, hire-car, limousine, and charter vehicle industry who were licensed to operate in particular regions of\\nAustralia during certain periods between April 2014 and August 2017. The class action alleges that we operated unlawfully in such regions during such periods.\\nThese legislative and regulatory proceedings, allegations, and lawsuits are expensive and time consuming to defend, and, if resolved adversely to us, could result in\\nfinancial damages or penalties, including criminal penalties, incarceration, and sanctions for individuals employed by us or parties with whom we contract, which\\ncould harm our ability to operate our business as planned in one or more of the jurisdictions in which we operate, which could adversely affect our business,\\nrevenue, and operating results.\\nIn addition, while we divested certain assets of our dockless e-bikes and e-scooters business to Lime in May 2020, consumers continue to have access to\\ndockless e-bikes and e-scooters through our app. We expect dockless e-bikes and e-scooters to subject us to additional risks distinct from those relating to our other\\nMobility, Delivery and Freight offerings. For example, consumers using dockless e-bikes or e-scooters face a more severe level of injury in the event of a collision\\nthan that faced while riding in a vehicle, given the less sophisticated, and in some cases absent, passive protection systems on dockless e-bikes and e-scooters. The\\noccurrence of real or perceived quality problems or material defects in current or future dockless e-bikes or e-scooters available via our app could result in negative\\npublicity, market withdrawals, regulatory proceedings, enforcement actions, or lawsuits filed against us, particularly if consumers are injured.\\nChanges in, or failure to comply with, competition laws could adversely affect our business, financial condition, or operating results.\\n35\\nCompetition authorities closely scrutinize us under U.S. and foreign antitrust and competition laws. An increasing number of governments are enforcing\\ncompetition laws and are doing so with increased scrutiny, including governments in large markets such as the EU, the United States, Brazil, and India, particularly\\nsurrounding issues of pricing parity, price-fixing, and abuse of market power. Many of these jurisdictions also allow competitors or consumers to assert claims of\\nanti-competitive conduct. For example, complaints have been filed in several jurisdictions, including in the United States and India, alleging that our prices are too\\nhigh (surge pricing) or too low (discounts or predatory pricing), or both. If one jurisdiction imposes or proposes to impose new requirements or restrictions on our\\nbusiness, other jurisdictions may follow. Further, any new requirements or restrictions, or proposed requirements or restrictions, could result in adverse publicity or\\nfines, whether or not valid or subject to appeal.\\nIn addition, governmental agencies and regulators may, among other things, prohibit future acquisitions, divestitures, or combinations we plan to make, impose\\nsignificant fines or penalties, require divestiture of certain of our assets, or impose other restrictions that limit or require us to modify our operations, including\\nlimitations on our contractual relationships with platform users or restrictions on our pricing models. Such rulings may alter the way in which we do business and,\\ntherefore, may continue to increase our costs or liabilities or reduce demand for our platform, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, or\\noperating results.\\nWe expect that the U.S. antitrust enforcement agencies (e.g., the DOJ and the FTC) will continue to closely scrutinize merger activity, with a particular focus\\non the technology sector, and there can be no assurance that proposed, completed or future mergers, acquisitions and divestitures will not be the subject of an\\ninvestigation or enforcement action by the DOJ or the FTC. Changes in antitrust laws globally, or in their interpretation, administration or enforcement, may limit\\nour future acquisitions, divestitures, operations and growth.\\nOur business is subject to extensive government regulation and oversight relating to the provision of payment and financial services.\\nMost jurisdictions in which we operate have laws that govern payment and financial services activities. Regulators in certain jurisdictions may determine that\\ncertain aspects of our business are subject to these laws and could require us to obtain licenses to continue to operate in such jurisdictions. For example, our\\nsubsidiary in the Netherlands, Uber Payments B.V., is registered and authorized by its competent authority, De Nederlandsche Bank, as an electronic money\\ninstitution. This authorization permits Uber Payments B.V. to provide payment services (including acquiring and executing payment transactions and money\\nremittances, as referred to in the Revised Payment Services Directive (2015/2366/EU)) and to issue electronic money in the Netherlands. In addition, Uber\\nPayments B.V. has notified De Nederlandsche Bank that it will provide such services on a cross-border passport basis into other countries within the EEA. We\\ncontinue to critically evaluate our options for seeking additional licenses and approvals in several other jurisdictions to optimize our payment solutions and support\\nthe future growth of our business. We could be denied such licenses, have existing licenses revoked, or be required to make significant changes to our business\\noperations before being granted such licenses. If we are denied payment or other financial licenses or such licenses are revoked, we could be forced to cease or\\nlimit business operations in certain jurisdictions, including in the EEA, and even if we are able to obtain such licenses, we could be subject to fines or other\\nenforcement action, or stripped of such licenses, if we are found to violate the requirements of such licenses. In some countries, it is not clear whether we are\\nrequired to be licensed as a payment services provider. Were local regulators to determine that such arrangements require us to be so licensed, such regulators may\\nblock payments to Drivers, merchants, Shippers or Carriers. Such regulatory actions, or the need to obtain regulatory approvals, could impose significant costs and\\ninvolve substantial delay in payments we make in certain local markets, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, or operating results.\\nStarting in December 2020, payments made by platform users with payment accounts in the EEA for services provided through our platform may be subject to\\nStrong Customer Authentication (“SCA”) regulatory requirements. In many cases, SCA will require a platform user to engage in additional steps to authenticate\\neach payment transaction. These additional authentication requirements in EEA or similar requirements, such as tokenization, in other countries may make our\\nplatform user experience substantially less convenient, and such loss of convenience could meaningfully reduce the frequency with which platform users use our\\nplatform or could cause some platform users to stop using our platform entirely, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results,\\nand prospects. Further, as a result of implementing SCA, many payment transactions on our platform may fail to be authenticated due to platform users not\\ncompleting all necessary authentication steps. Thus, in some cases, we may not receive payment from consumers in advance of paying Drivers for services received\\nby those users. A substantial increase in the frequency with which we make Driver payments without having received corresponding payments from consumers\\ncould adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, and prospects.\\nIn addition, laws related to money transmission and online payments are evolving, and changes in such laws could affect our ability to provide payment\\nprocessing on our platform in the same form and on the same terms as we have historically, or at all. For example, changes to our business in Europe, combined\\nwith changes to the EU Payment Services Directive, caused aspects of our payment operations in the EEA to fall within the scope of European payments\\nregulation. As a result, one of our subsidiaries, Uber Payments B.V., is directly subject to financial services regulations (including those relating to anti-money\\nlaundering, terrorist financing, and sanctioned or prohibited persons) in the Netherlands and in other countries in the EEA where it conducts business. Effective\\nJuly 1, 2020, we transitioned all our payment operations to the Uber Payments B.V. regulated entity in the EEA countries in which we are required to do so by the\\nEuropean payments regulations.\\n36\\nIn addition, as we evolve our business or make changes to our business structure, we may be subject to additional laws or requirements related to money\\ntransmission, online payments, and financial regulation. These laws govern, among other things, money transmission, prepaid access instruments, electronic funds\\ntransfers, anti-money laundering, counter-terrorist financing, banking, systemic integrity risk assessments, security of payment processes, and import and export\\nrestrictions. Our business operations, including our payments to Drivers and merchants, may not always comply with these financial laws and regulations.\\nHistorical or future non-compliance with these laws or regulations could result in significant criminal and civil lawsuits, penalties, forfeiture of significant assets, or\\nother enforcement actions. Costs associated with fines and enforcement actions, as well as reputational harm, changes in compliance requirements, or limits on our\\nability to expand our product offerings, could harm our business.\\nFurther, our payment system is susceptible to illegal and improper uses, including money laundering, terrorist financing, fraudulent sales of goods or services,\\nand payments to sanctioned parties. We have invested and will need to continue to invest substantial resources to comply with applicable anti-money laundering\\nand sanctions laws, and in the EEA to conduct appropriate risk assessments and implement appropriate controls as a regulated financial service provider.\\nGovernment authorities may seek to bring legal action against us if our payment system is used for improper or illegal purposes or if our enterprise risk\\nmanagement or controls in the EEA are not adequately assessed, updated, or implemented, and any such action could result in financial or reputational harm to our\\nbusiness.\\nWe currently are subject to a number of inquiries, investigations, and requests for information from the DOJ, other federal, state and local government\\nagencies and other foreign government agencies, the adverse outcomes of which could harm our business.\\nWe are the subject of DOJ inquiries and investigations, as well as enforcement inquiries and investigations by other federal, state and local government\\nagencies and other regulators abroad. Those inquiries and investigations cover a broad range of matters, including but not limited to, our business practices, such as\\nfees, pricing, and related disclosures, relationships with third parties, and data privacy and security incidents. For example, in September 2018, after investigations\\nand various lawsuits relating to the 2016 Breach, we settled with the Attorneys General of all 50 U.S. states and the District of Columbia through stipulated\\njudgments and payment in an aggregate amount of $148 million related to our failure to report the incident for approximately one year. In April 2018, we entered\\ninto a consent decree that lasts through 2038 covering the 2014 Breach and the 2016 Breach with the FTC, which the FTC Commissioners approved in October\\n2018. In November and December 2018, UK, Dutch and French regulators imposed fines totaling approximately $1.6 million related to the 2016 Breach. In\\naddition, in July 2022, we entered into a non-prosecution agreement with the DOJ concerning its investigation into our handling of the 2016 Breach. The 2016\\nBreach has led to, and it, as well as other security incidents we experience, may continue to lead to, costly and time-consuming regulatory investigations and\\nlitigation from other government entities, as well as potentially material fines and penalties imposed by other U.S. and international regulators. Investigations and\\nenforcement actions from such entities, as well as continued negative publicity and an erosion of current and prospective platform users’ trust, could severely\\ndisrupt our business. In addition, in March 2022, Uber Technologies, Inc. and Uber B.V. were each fined €2.12 million by the Italian data protection authority for\\nalleged privacy violations stemming from an investigation conducted in 2018.\\nWe are also subject to inquiries and investigations by government agencies related to certain transactions we have entered into in the United States and other\\ncountries.\\nThese government inquiries and investigations are time-consuming and require a great deal of financial resources and attention from us and our senior\\nmanagement. If any of these matters are resolved adversely to us, we may be subject to additional fines, penalties, and other sanctions, and could be forced to\\nchange our business practices substantially in the relevant jurisdictions. Any such determinations could also result in significant adverse publicity or additional\\nreputational harm, and could result in or complicate other inquiries, investigations, or lawsuits from other regulators in future merger control or conduct\\ninvestigations. Any of these developments could result in material financial damages, operational restrictions, and harm our business.\\nWe face risks related to our collection, use, transfer, disclosure, and other processing of data, which could result in investigations, inquiries, litigation, fines,\\nlegislative and regulatory action, and negative press about our privacy and data protection practices.\\nThe nature of our business exposes us to claims, including civil lawsuits in the United States such as those related to the 2014 Breach and the 2016 Breach.\\nThese and any past or future privacy or security incidents could result in violation of applicable U.S. and international privacy, data protection, and other laws.\\nSuch violations subject us to individual or consumer class action litigation as well as governmental investigations and proceedings by federal, state, and local\\nregulatory entities in the United States and internationally, resulting in exposure to material civil or criminal liability. Our data security and privacy practices have\\nbeen the subject of inquiries from government agencies and regulators, not all of which are finally resolved. In April 2018, we entered into an FTC consent decree\\npursuant to which we agreed, among other things, to implement a comprehensive privacy program, undergo biennial third-party assessments, and not misrepresent\\nhow we protect consumer information through 2038. In October 2018, the FTC approved the final settlement, which exposes us to penalties for, amongst other\\nactivities, future failure to report security incidents. In November and December 2018, UK, Dutch and French supervisory authorities imposed fines totaling\\napproximately $1.6 million. We have also entered into settlement agreements with numerous state enforcement agencies. For example, in January 2016, we entered\\ninto a settlement with the Office of the New York State Attorney General under which we agreed to enhance our data security practices. In addition, in September\\n2018, we entered into stipulated judgments with the state attorneys general of all 50 U.S. states\\n37\\nand the District of Columbia relating to the 2016 Breach, which involved payment of $148 million and assurances that we would enhance our data security and\\nprivacy practices. In addition, in March 2022, Uber Technologies, Inc. and Uber B.V. were each fined €2.12 million by the Italian data protection authority for\\nalleged privacy violations stemming from an investigation conducted in 2018. Additionally, in July 2022, we entered into a non-prosecution agreement with the\\nDOJ concerning its investigation into our handling of the 2016 Breach. Failure to comply with these and other orders could result in substantial fines, enforcement\\nactions, injunctive relief, and other penalties that may be costly or that may impact our business. We may also assume liabilities for breaches experienced by the\\ncompanies we acquire as we expand our operations. For example, in April 2018, Careem publicly disclosed and notified relevant regulatory authorities that it had\\nbeen subject to a data security incident that allowed access to certain personal information of riders and drivers on its platform as of January 14, 2018. If Careem\\nbecomes subject to liability as a result of this or other data security incidents or if we fail to remediate this or any other data security incident that Careem or we\\nexperience, we may face harm to our brand, business disruption, and significant liabilities. In addition, in July 2020, Drizly publicly disclosed that it had been\\nsubject to a data security incident that allowed access to certain personal information of customers on its platform, and in November 2021 Drizly obtained final\\ncourt approval of a settlement in a resulting class action litigation. Moreover, in January 2023, the FTC announced a final order relating to the data security\\nincident. If Drizly becomes subject to additional liability or regulatory or court orders as a result of this or other data security incidents or if we fail to remediate\\nthis or any other data security incident that Drizly or we experience, we may face harm to our brand, business disruption, and significant liabilities. Our insurance\\nprograms may not cover all potential claims to which we are exposed and may not be adequate to indemnify us for the full extent of our potential liabilities.\\nThis risk is enhanced in certain jurisdictions with stringent privacy laws and, as we expand our products, offerings, and operations domestically and\\ninternationally, we have, and may continue to become subject to amended or additional laws that impose substantial additional obligations related to data privacy\\nand security. The EU adopted the GDPR in 2016, and it became effective in May 2018. The GDPR applies extraterritorially and imposes stringent requirements for\\ncontrollers and processors of personal data. Such requirements include higher consent standards to process personal data, robust disclosures regarding the use of\\npersonal data, strengthened individual data rights, data breach requirements, limitations on data retention, strengthened requirements for special categories of\\npersonal data and pseudonymised (i.e., key-coded) data, and additional obligations for contracting with service providers that may process personal data. The\\nGDPR further provides that EU member states may institute additional laws and regulations impacting the processing of personal data, including (i) special\\ncategories of personal data (e.g., racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, and religious or philosophical beliefs) and (ii) profiling of individuals and automated\\nindividual decision-making. Such additional laws and regulations could limit our ability to use and share personal or other data, thereby increasing our costs and\\nharming our business and financial condition. Non-compliance with the GDPR (including any non-compliance by any acquired business) is subject to significant\\npenalties, including fines of up to the greater of €20 million or 4% of total worldwide revenue, and injunctions against the processing of personal data. Other\\njurisdictions outside the EU are similarly introducing or enhancing privacy and data security laws, rules, and regulations, which will increase our compliance costs\\nand the risks associated with non-compliance. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”), which provided new privacy rights for consumers and\\nnew operational requirements for businesses, went into effect in January 2020. The CCPA includes a statutory damages framework and private rights of action\\nagainst businesses that fail to comply with certain CCPA terms or implement reasonable security procedures and practices to prevent data breaches. Other U.S.\\nstates have adopted, and likely will continue to adopt, similar laws that provide new consumer privacy rights and business operational requirements. Brazil\\nprovides another example, having passed the General Data Protection Law (Lei Geral de Proteção de Dados Pessoais, or LGPD) in 2018, which is now in effect.\\nThese laws may be subject to amendments and regulations that may change over time, or result in additional follow-on laws such as the California Privacy Rights\\nAct (“CPRA”) passed in California in November 2020.\\nAdditionally, we are subject to laws, rules, and regulations regarding cross-border transfers of personal data, including laws relating to transfer of personal data\\noutside the EEA. We rely on transfer mechanisms permitted under these laws, including the EU Standard Contract Clauses. Such mechanisms have received\\nheightened regulatory and judicial scrutiny and have undergone modifications, and a 2020 decision by the Court of Justice of the European Union casts doubt on\\nthe adequacy of all of the formerly-approved mechanisms for transferring personal data from countries in the EEA to certain other countries such as the United\\nStates. If we cannot rely on existing mechanisms for transferring personal data from the EEA, the United Kingdom, or other jurisdictions, we may be unable to\\ntransfer personal data of Drivers, consumers, or employees in those regions, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating\\nresults. In addition, we may be required to disclose personal data pursuant to demands from government agencies, including from state and city regulators as a\\nrequirement for obtaining or maintaining a license or otherwise, from law enforcement agencies, and from intelligence agencies. This disclosure may result in a\\nfailure or perceived failure by us to comply with privacy and data protection policies, notices, laws, rules, and regulations, could result in proceedings or actions\\nagainst us in the same or other jurisdictions, and could have an adverse impact on our reputation and brand. In addition, Careem has historically shared certain user\\ndata with certain government authorities, which conflicts with our global policies regarding data use, sharing, and ownership. We expect to maintain our data use,\\nsharing, and ownership practices for both our business and Careem’s business, and doing so may cause our relationship with government authorities in certain\\njurisdictions to suffer, and may result in such government authorities assessing significant fines or penalties against us or shutting down our or Careem’s app on\\neither a temporary or indefinite basis. Further, if any jurisdiction in which we operate changes its laws, rules, or regulations relating to data residency or local\\ncomputation such that we are unable to comply in a timely manner or at all, we may risk losing our rights to operate in such jurisdictions. This could adversely\\naffect the manner in which we provide our products and offerings and thus materially affect our\\n38\\noperations and financial results.\\nSuch data protection laws, rules, and regulations are complex and their interpretation is rapidly evolving, making implementation and enforcement, and thus\\ncompliance requirements, ambiguous, uncertain, and potentially inconsistent. Compliance with such laws may require changes to our data collection, use, transfer,\\ndisclosure, and other processing and certain other related business practices and may thereby increase compliance costs. Additionally, any failure or perceived\\nfailure by us to comply with privacy and data protection policies, notices, laws, rules, orders and regulations could result in proceedings or actions against us by\\nindividuals, consumer rights groups, governmental entities or agencies, or others. We could incur significant costs investigating and defending such claims and, if\\nfound liable, significant damages. Further, these proceedings and any subsequent adverse outcomes may subject us to significant penalties and negative publicity. If\\nany of these events were to occur, our business and financial results could be significantly disrupted and adversely affected.\\nAdverse litigation judgments or settlements resulting from legal proceedings in which we may be involved could expose us to monetary damages or limit our\\nability to operate our business.\\nWe have in the past been, are currently, and may in the future become, involved in private actions, collective actions, investigations, and various other legal\\nproceedings by Drivers, consumers, merchants, Shippers, Carriers, employees, commercial partners, competitors or, government agencies, among others. We are\\nsubject to litigation relating to various matters including Driver classification, Drivers’ tips and taxes, the Americans with Disabilities Act, antitrust, intellectual\\nproperty infringement, privacy, unfair competition, workplace culture, safety practices, and employment and human resources practices. The results of any such\\nlitigation, investigations, and legal proceedings are inherently unpredictable and expensive. Any claims against us, whether meritorious or not, could be time\\nconsuming, costly, and harmful to our reputation, and could require significant amounts of management time and corporate resources. If any of these legal\\nproceedings were to be determined adversely to us, or we were to enter into a settlement arrangement, we could be exposed to monetary damages or be forced to\\nchange the way in which we operate our business, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results.\\nIn addition, we regularly include arbitration provisions in our terms of service with end-users. These provisions are intended to streamline the litigation process\\nfor all parties involved, as arbitration can in some cases be faster and less costly than litigating disputes in state or federal court. However, arbitration may become\\nmore costly for us, or the volume of arbitrations may increase and become burdensome. Further, the use of arbitration provisions may subject us to certain risks to\\nour reputation and brand, as these provisions have been the subject of increasing public scrutiny. To minimize these risks, we have in the past and may in the future\\nvoluntarily limit our use of arbitration provisions, or we may be required to do so, in any legal or regulatory proceeding, either of which could increase our\\nlitigation costs and exposure in respect of such proceedings. For example, effective May 15, 2018, we ended mandatory arbitration of sexual misconduct claims by\\nplatform users and employees.\\nFurther, with the potential for conflicting rules regarding the scope and enforceability of arbitration on a state-by-state basis, as well as conflicting rules\\nbetween state and federal law, some or all of our arbitration provisions could be subject to challenge or may need to be revised to exempt certain categories of\\nprotection. If our arbitration agreements were found to be unenforceable, in whole or in part, or specific claims were required to be exempted from arbitration, we\\ncould experience an increase in our litigation costs and the time involved in resolving such disputes, and we could face increased exposure to potentially costly\\nlawsuits, each of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, and prospects.\\nWe have operations in countries known to experience high levels of corruption and were previously subject to, and may in the future be subject to, inquiries,\\ninvestigations, and requests for information with respect to our compliance with a number of anti-corruption laws to which we are subject.\\nWe have operations in, and have business relationships with, entities in countries known to experience high levels of corruption. We are subject to the FCPA\\nand other similar laws outside the United States that prohibit improper payments or offers of payments to foreign governments, their officials, and political parties\\nfor the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. U.S. and non-U.S. regulators alike continue to focus on the enforcement of these laws, and we may be subject to\\nadditional compliance requirements to identify criminal activity and payments to sanctioned parties. Our activities in certain countries with high levels of\\ncorruption enhance the risk of unauthorized payments or offers of payments by Drivers, consumers, merchants, Shippers or Carriers, employees, consultants, or\\nbusiness partners in violation of various anti-corruption laws, including the FCPA, even though the actions of these parties are often outside our control. Our\\nacquisition of Careem may further enhance this risk because users of Careem’s platform and Careem’s employees, consultants, and business partners may not be\\nfamiliar with, and may not have been previously subject to, these anti-corruption laws. In addition, our existing and future safeguards, including training and\\ncompliance programs to discourage these practices by such parties, may not prove effective, and such parties may engage in conduct for which we could be held\\nresponsible. Additional compliance requirements may compel us to revise or expand our compliance program, including the procedures we use to verify the\\nidentity of platform users and monitor international and domestic transactions.\\n39\\nDrivers may become subject to increased licensing requirements, and we may be required to obtain additional licenses or cap the number of Drivers using our\\nplatform.\\nMany Drivers currently are not required to obtain a commercial taxi or livery license in their respective jurisdictions. However, numerous jurisdictions in\\nwhich we operate have conducted investigations or taken action to enforce existing licensing rules, including markets within Latin America and the Asia-Pacific\\nregion, and many others, including countries in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa, have adopted or proposed new laws or regulations that require Drivers to be\\nlicensed with local authorities or require us or our subsidiaries to be licensed as a transportation company. Local regulations requiring the licensing of us or Drivers\\nmay adversely affect our ability to scale our business and operations. In addition, it is possible that various jurisdictions could impose caps on the number of\\nlicensed Drivers or vehicles with whom we may partner or impose limitations on the maximum number of hours a Driver may work, similar to recent regulations\\nthat were adopted in Spain and New York City, which have temporarily frozen new vehicle licenses for Drivers using platforms like ours. If we or Drivers become\\nsubject to such caps, limitations, or licensing requirements, our business and growth prospects would be adversely impacted.\\nWe may be subject to liability for the means we use to attract and onboard Drivers.\\nWe operate in an industry in which the competition for Drivers is intense. In this highly competitive environment, the means we use to onboard and attract\\nDrivers may be challenged by competitors, government regulators, or individual plaintiffs. For example, putative class actions have been filed by individual\\nplaintiffs against us for alleged violation of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991, alleging, among other things, that plaintiffs received text messages\\nfrom us regarding our Driver program without their consent or after indicating to us they no longer wished to receive such text messages. These lawsuits are\\nexpensive and time consuming to defend, and, if resolved adversely to us, could result in material financial damages and penalties, costly adjustments to our\\nbusiness practices, and negative publicity. In addition, we could incur substantial expense and possible loss of revenue if competitors file additional lawsuits or\\nother claims challenging these practices.\\nOur business depends heavily on insurance coverage for Drivers and on other types of insurance for additional risks related to our business. If insurance\\ncarriers change the terms of such insurance in a manner not favorable to Drivers or to us, if we are required to purchase additional insurance for other aspects\\nof our business, or if we fail to comply with regulations governing insurance coverage, our business could be harmed.\\nWe use a combination of third-party insurance and self-insurance mechanisms, including a wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiary. Insurance related to our\\nMobility products may include third-party automobile, automobile comprehensive and collision, physical damage, and uninsured and underinsured motorist\\ncoverage. We require Drivers to carry automobile insurance in most countries, and in many cases we also maintain insurance on behalf of Drivers. We rely on a\\nlimited number of ridesharing insurance providers, particularly internationally, and should such providers discontinue or increase the cost of coverage, we cannot\\nguarantee that we would be able to secure replacement coverage on reasonable terms or at all. In addition to insurance related to our products, we maintain other\\nautomobile insurance coverage for owned vehicles and employee activity, as well as insurance coverage for non-automotive corporate risks including general\\nliability, workers’ compensation, property, cyber liability, and director and officers’ liability. If our insurance carriers change the terms of our policies in a manner\\nunfavorable to us or Drivers, our insurance costs could increase. The cost of insurance that we maintain on behalf of Drivers is higher in the United States and\\nCanada than in other geographies. Further, if the insurance coverage we maintain is not adequate to cover losses that occur, we could be liable for significant\\nadditional costs.\\nIn addition, we and our captive insurance subsidiary are party to certain reinsurance and indemnification arrangements that transfer a significant portion of the\\nrisk from the insurance provider to us or our captive insurance subsidiary, which could require us to pay out material amounts that may be in excess of our\\ninsurance reserves, resulting in harm to our financial condition. Our insurance reserves account for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses for risks retained by\\nus through our captive insurance subsidiary and other risk retention mechanisms. Such amounts are based on actuarial estimates, historical claim information, and\\nindustry data. While management believes that these reserve amounts are adequate, the ultimate liability could be in excess of our reserves. We also have\\nrequirements to post collateral for current and future claim settlement obligations with certain of our insurance carriers, which may have a significant impact on our\\nunrestricted cash and cash equivalents available for general business purposes.\\nWe may be subject to claims of significant liability based on traffic accidents, injuries, or other incidents that are claimed to have been caused by Drivers who\\nuse our platform, even when those Drivers are not actively using our platform or when an individual impersonates a Driver. As we expand to include more offerings\\non our platform, our insurance needs will likely extend to those additional offerings, including Freight. As a result, our automobile liability and general liability\\ninsurance policies and insurance maintained by Drivers may not cover all potential claims related to traffic accidents, injuries, or other incidents that are claimed to\\nhave been caused by Drivers who use our platform, and may not be adequate to indemnify us for all liability that we could face. Even if these claims do not result\\nin liability, we could incur significant costs in investigating and defending against them. If insurers become insolvent, they may not be able to pay otherwise valid\\nclaims in a timely manner or at all. If we are subject to claims of liability relating to the acts of Drivers or others using our platform, we may be subject to negative\\npublicity and incur additional expenses, which could harm our business, financial condition, and operating results.\\nIn addition, we are subject to local laws, rules, and regulations relating to insurance coverage which could result in proceedings or\\n40\\nactions against us by governmental entities or others. Legislation has been passed in many U.S. jurisdictions that codifies these insurance requirements with respect\\nto ridesharing. Additional legislation has been proposed in other jurisdictions that seeks to codify or change insurance requirements with respect to ridesharing.\\nFurther, service providers and business customers of Freight and Uber for Business may require higher levels of coverage as a condition to entering into certain key\\ncontracts with us. Any failure, or perceived failure, by us to comply with local laws, rules, and regulations or contractual obligations relating to insurance coverage\\ncould result in proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or others. These lawsuits, proceedings, or actions may subject us to significant penalties\\nand negative publicity, require us to increase our insurance coverage, require us to amend our insurance policy disclosure, increase our costs, and disrupt our\\nbusiness.\\nWe may be subject to pricing regulations, as well as related litigation or regulatory inquiries.\\nOur revenue is dependent on the pricing models we use to calculate consumer fares and Driver earnings. Our pricing models, including dynamic pricing, have\\nbeen, and will likely continue to be, challenged, banned, limited in emergencies, and capped in certain jurisdictions. For example, we have agreed to not calculate\\nconsumer fares in excess of the maximum government-mandated fares in all major Indian cities where legal proceedings have limited the use of surge pricing.\\nFurther, in 2018, Honolulu, Hawaii became the first U.S. city to pass legislation to cap surge pricing if increased rates exceed the maximum fare set by the city.\\nAdditional regulation of our pricing models could increase our operating costs and adversely affect our business. Furthermore, our pricing model has been the\\nsubject of litigation and regulatory inquiries related to, among other things, the calculation of and statements regarding consumer fares and Driver earnings\\n(including rates, fees, surcharges, and tolls), as well as the use of surge pricing during emergencies and natural disasters. In addition, an increasing number of\\nmunicipalities have proposed delivery network fee caps with respect to our Delivery offering and caps on surge pricing with respect to our Mobility offering. As a\\nresult, we may be forced to change our pricing models in certain jurisdictions, which could harm our revenue or result in a sub-optimal tax structure.\\nIf we are unable to protect our intellectual property, or if third parties are successful in claiming that we are misappropriating the intellectual property of\\nothers, we may incur significant expense and our business may be adversely affected.\\nOur intellectual property includes the content of our website, mobile applications, registered domain names, software code, firmware, hardware and hardware\\ndesigns, registered and unregistered trademarks, trademark applications, copyrights, trade secrets, inventions (whether or not patentable), patents, and patent\\napplications. We believe that our intellectual property is essential to our business and affords us a competitive advantage in the markets in which we operate. If we\\ndo not adequately protect our intellectual property, our brand and reputation may be harmed, Drivers, consumers, merchants, Shippers, and Carriers could devalue\\nour products and offerings, and our ability to compete effectively may be impaired.\\nTo protect our intellectual property, we rely on a combination of copyright, trademark, patent, and trade secret laws, contractual provisions, end-user policies,\\nand disclosure restrictions. Upon discovery of potential infringement of our intellectual property, we assess and when necessary, take action to protect our rights as\\nappropriate. We also enter into confidentiality agreements and invention assignment agreements with our employees and consultants and seek to control access to,\\nand distribution of, our proprietary information in a commercially prudent manner. The efforts we have taken and may take to protect our intellectual property may\\nnot be sufficient or effective. For example, effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which we currently or in the future\\nwill operate. In addition, it may be possible for other parties to copy or reverse-engineer our products and offerings or obtain and use the content of our website\\nwithout authorization. Further, we may be unable to prevent competitors or other third parties from acquiring or using domain names or trademarks that are similar\\nto, infringe upon, or diminish the value of our domain names, trademarks, service marks, and other proprietary rights. Moreover, our trade secrets may be\\ncompromised by third parties or our employees, which would cause us to lose the competitive advantage derived from the compromised trade secrets. Further, we\\nmay be unable to detect infringement of our intellectual property rights, and even if we detect such violations and decide to enforce our intellectual property rights,\\nwe may not be successful, and may incur significant expenses, in such efforts. In addition, any such enforcement efforts may be time-consuming and may divert\\nmanagement’s attention. Further, such enforcement efforts may result in a ruling that our intellectual property rights are unenforceable or invalid. Any failure to\\nprotect or any loss of our intellectual property may have an adverse effect on our ability to compete and may adversely affect our business, financial condition, or\\noperating results.\\nCompanies in the Internet and technology industries, and other patent and trademark holders, including “non-practicing entities,” seeking to profit from\\nroyalties in connection with grants of licenses or seeking to obtain injunctions, own large numbers of patents, copyrights, trademarks, and trade secrets and\\nfrequently enter into litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. We have and may in the future continue to\\nreceive notices that claim we have misappropriated, misused, or infringed upon other parties’ intellectual property rights.\\nFurthermore, from time to time we may introduce or acquire new products, including in areas in which we historically have not operated, which could increase\\nour exposure to patent and other intellectual property claims. In addition, we, and companies we acquired or in which we have an interest, have been sued, and may\\nin the future be sued, for allegations of intellectual property infringement or threats of trade secret misappropriation. If a company we acquire or in which we have\\nan interest loses rights to valuable intellectual property or is found to infringe third party intellectual property rights in such lawsuits, the value of our investment\\nmay materially decline.\\n41\\nAny intellectual property claim against us, regardless of merit, could be time consuming and expensive to settle or litigate, could divert our management’s\\nattention and other resources, and could hurt goodwill associated with our brand. These claims may also subject us to significant liability for damages and may\\nresult in us having to stop using technology, content, branding, or business methods found to be in violation of another party’s rights. Further, certain adverse\\noutcomes of such proceedings could adversely affect our ability to compete effectively in existing or future businesses.\\nWe may be required or may opt to seek a license for the right to use intellectual property held by others, which may not be available on commercially\\nreasonable terms, or at all. Even if a license is available, we may be required to pay significant royalties or license fees, which may increase our operating expenses.\\nWe may also be required to develop alternative non-infringing technology, content, branding, or business methods, which could require significant effort and\\nexpense and make us less competitive. If we cannot license or develop alternative technology, content, branding, or business methods for any allegedly infringing\\naspect of our business, we may be unable to compete effectively or we may be prevented from operating our business in certain jurisdictions. Any of these results\\ncould harm our operating results.\\nOur reported financial results may be adversely affected by changes in accounting principles.\\nThe accounting for our business is complicated, particularly in the area of revenue recognition, and is subject to change based on the evolution of our business\\nmodel, interpretations of relevant accounting principles, enforcement of existing or new regulations, and changes in SEC or other agency policies, rules,\\nregulations, and interpretations, of accounting regulations. Changes to our business model and accounting methods could result in changes to our financial\\nstatements, including changes in revenue and expenses in any period, or in certain categories of revenue and expenses moving to different periods, may result in\\nmaterially different financial results, and may require that we change how we process, analyze, and report financial information and our financial reporting\\ncontrols.\\nIf we are deemed an investment company under the Investment Company Act, applicable restrictions could have an adverse effect on our business.\\nThe Investment Company Act contains substantive legal requirements that regulate the manner in which “investment companies” are permitted to conduct their\\nbusiness activities. We believe that we have conducted our business in a manner that does not result in being characterized as an “investment company” under the\\nInvestment Company Act because we are primarily engaged in a non-investment company business. Although a significant portion of our assets constitute\\ninvestments in non-controlled entities (including in China), referred to elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K as minority-owned affiliates, we believe that\\nwe are not an investment company as defined by the Investment Company Act. While we intend to conduct our operations such that we will not be deemed an\\ninvestment company, such a determination would require us to initiate burdensome compliance requirements and comply with restrictions imposed by the\\nInvestment Company Act that would limit our activities, including limitations on our capital structure and our ability to transact with affiliates, which would have\\nan adverse effect on our financial condition. To avoid such a determination, we may be required to conduct our business in a manner that does not subject us to the\\nrequirements of the Investment Company Act, which could have an adverse effect on our business. For example, we may be required to sell certain of our assets\\nand pay significant taxes upon the sale or transfer of such assets.\\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\\nThe market price of our common stock has been, and may continue to be, volatile or may decline steeply or suddenly regardless of our operating performance,\\nand we may not be able to meet investor or analyst expectations. You may not be able to resell your shares at or above the price you paid and may lose all or\\npart of your investment.\\nThe market price of our common stock may fluctuate or decline significantly in response to numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control,\\nincluding:\\n•\\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in MAPCs, Trips, Adjusted EBITDA, Free Cash Flow, Gross Bookings, revenue, or other operating and financial\\nresults;\\n•\\nannouncements by us or estimates by third parties of actual or anticipated changes in the number of Drivers and consumers on our platform;\\n•\\nvariations between our actual operating results and the expectations of our management, securities analysts, investors, the financial community;\\n•\\nchanges in accounting principles or changes in interpretations of existing principles, which could affect financial results;\\n•\\nactions of securities analysts who initiate or maintain coverage of us, changes in financial estimates by any securities analysts who follow our\\ncompany, or our failure to meet these estimates or the expectations of investors;\\n•\\nannouncements by us or our competitors of significant products or features, technical innovations, acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures, or\\ncapital commitments;\\n•\\nnegative media coverage or publicity;\\n•\\nchanges in operating performance and stock market valuations of technology companies generally, or those in our\\n42\\nindustry in particular, including our competitors;\\n•\\nprice and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market, including as a result of trends in the economy as a whole;\\n•\\nlawsuits threatened, filed, or decided against us;\\n•\\ndevelopments in legislation or regulatory actions, including interim or final rulings by judicial or regulatory bodies (including any competition\\nauthorities blocking, delaying, or subjecting our pending acquisitions to significant limitations or restrictions on our ability to operate in one or more\\nmarkets, or requiring us to divest our or any target company’s assets or businesses in one or more markets);\\n•\\nchanges in accounting standards, policies, guidelines, interpretations, or principles;\\n•\\nany major change in our board of directors or management;\\n•\\nany safety incidents or public reports of safety incidents that occur on our platform or in our industry;\\n•\\nstatements, commentary, or opinions by public officials that our product offerings are or may be unlawful, regardless of any interim or final rulings by\\njudicial or regulatory bodies; and\\n•\\nother events or factors, including those resulting from war, incidents of terrorism, natural disasters, public health concerns or epidemics, pandemics,\\nnatural disasters, or responses to these events.\\nIn addition, price and volume fluctuations in the stock markets have affected and continue to affect many technology companies’ stock prices. Often, their\\nstock prices have fluctuated in ways unrelated or disproportionate to the companies’ operating performance. In the past, stockholders have filed securities class\\naction litigation following periods of market volatility. For example, beginning in September 2019, several putative class actions were filed in California state and\\nfederal courts against us, our directors, certain of our officers, and the underwriters named in our IPO registration statement alleging violations of securities laws in\\nconnection with our IPO. Securities litigation could subject us to substantial costs, divert resources and the attention of management from our business, and\\nseriously harm our business. In addition, the occurrence of any of the factors listed above, among others, may cause our stock price to decline significantly, and\\nthere can be no assurance that our stock price would recover. As such, you may not be able to sell your shares at or above the price you paid, and you may lose\\nsome or all of your investment.\\nDelaware law and provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws could make a merger, tender offer, or\\nproxy contest difficult, thereby depressing the trading price of our common stock.\\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that could depress the trading price of our common\\nstock by acting to discourage, delay, or prevent a change of control of our company or changes in our management that the stockholders of our company may deem\\nadvantageous. These provisions include the following:\\n•\\nour board of directors has the right to elect directors to fill vacancies created by the expansion of our board of directors or the resignation, death, or\\nremoval of a director, which prevents stockholders from being able to fill vacancies on our board of directors;\\n•\\nadvance notice requirements for stockholder proposals, which may reduce the number of stockholder proposals available for stockholder consideration;\\n•\\nlimitations on stockholder ability to convene special stockholder meetings, which could make it difficult for our stockholders to adopt desired\\ngovernance changes;\\n•\\nprohibition on cumulative voting in the election of directors, which limits the ability of minority stockholders to elect director candidates; and\\n•\\nour board of directors is able to issue, without stockholder approval, shares of undesignated preferred stock, which makes it possible for our board of\\ndirectors to issue preferred stock with voting or other rights or preferences that could impede the success of any attempt to acquire us.\\nAny provision of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, amended and restated bylaws, or Delaware law that has the effect of delaying or\\ndeterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our common stock, and could also affect the\\nprice that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock. In addition, under our existing debt instruments, we, and certain of our subsidiaries, are subject\\nto certain limitations on our business and operations, including limitations on certain consolidations, mergers, and sales of assets. For information regarding these\\nand other provisions, see the risk factor titled “-We have incurred a significant amount of debt and may in the future incur additional indebtedness. Our payment\\nobligations under such indebtedness may limit the funds available to us, and the terms of our debt agreements may restrict our flexibility in operating our business.”\\nSales, directly or indirectly, of shares of our common stock by existing stockholders could cause our stock price to decline.\\n43\\nSales, directly or indirectly, of a substantial number of shares of our common stock, or the public perception that these sales might occur, could depress the\\nmarket price of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities. We may issue our shares of common\\nstock or securities convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for our common stock from time to time in connection with a financing, acquisition, investments\\nor otherwise. Such issuances, including the issuance of additional shares of our common stock upon exercise of such equity awards, could result in substantial\\ndilution to our existing stockholders and cause the trading price of our common stock to decline.\\nWe do not intend to pay cash dividends for the foreseeable future.\\nWe have never declared or paid cash dividends on our capital stock. We currently intend to retain any future earnings to finance the operation and expansion of\\nour business, and we do not expect to declare or pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. In addition, certain of our existing debt instruments include\\nrestrictions on our ability to pay cash dividends. As a result, you may only receive a return on your investment in our common stock if the market price of our\\ncommon stock increases.\\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware and, to the extent enforceable, the federal\\ndistrict courts of the United States of America are the exclusive forums for substantially all disputes between us and our stockholders, which could limit our\\nstockholders’ ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or employees.\\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is the exclusive forum for the following\\ntypes of actions or proceedings under Delaware statutory or common law:\\n•\\nany derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf;\\n•\\nany action asserting a breach of fiduciary duty;\\n•\\nany action asserting a claim against us or our directors, officers, or employees arising under the Delaware General Corporation Law, our amended and\\nrestated certificate of incorporation, or our amended and restated bylaws;\\n•\\nany action regarding our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or our amended and restated bylaws;\\n•\\nany action as to which the Delaware General Corporation Law confers jurisdiction to the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware; and\\n•\\nany action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal-affairs doctrine.\\nThis provision would not apply to suits brought to enforce a duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or any other claim for which the U.S. federal courts\\nhave exclusive jurisdiction.\\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that the federal district courts of the United States of America will be the exclusive forum for\\nresolving any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act, subject to and contingent upon a final adjudication in the State of Delaware of\\nthe enforceability of such exclusive forum provision. Although the Delaware Supreme Court has held that such exclusive forum provisions are facially valid, courts\\nin other jurisdictions may find such provisions to be unenforceable.\\nThese exclusive-forum provisions may limit a stockholder’s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our\\ndirectors, officers, or other employees, which may discourage lawsuits against us and our directors, officers, and other employees. If any other court of competent\\njurisdiction were to find either exclusive-forum provision in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to be inapplicable or unenforceable, we may\\nincur additional costs associated with resolving the dispute in other jurisdictions, which could seriously harm our business.\\nIf we are unable to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting in the future, investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of\\nour financial reports, and the market price of our common stock may be harmed.\\nAs a result of being a public company, we are obligated to develop and maintain proper and effective internal controls over financial reporting, and any failure\\nto maintain the adequacy of these internal controls may adversely affect investor confidence in our company and, as a result, the value of our common stock.\\nWe are required, pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (“Section 404”), to furnish an annual report by management on, among other things, the\\neffectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. In addition, our independent registered public accounting firm is required to attest to the effectiveness\\nof our internal control over financial annually. We currently are required to disclose changes in internal control over financial reporting that have materially\\naffected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting on a quarterly basis.\\nThe process of compiling the system and processing documentation necessary to perform the evaluation needed to comply with Section 404 is costly and\\nchallenging, and we may not be able to complete evaluation, testing, and any required remediation in a timely fashion. As our business continues to grow in size\\nand complexity, we are improving our processes and infrastructure to help ensure we can prepare financial reporting and disclosures within the timeline required\\nfor a public company. During the evaluation and\\n44\\ntesting process of our internal controls, if we identify one or more material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, we will be unable to assert\\nthat our internal control over financial reporting is effective.\\nWe cannot assure you that there will not be material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting in the future, particularly due to high growth\\nofferings (such as with Delivery and Freight), which may cause challenges in consistent performance and timely designing new controls. Any failure to maintain\\ninternal control over financial reporting could severely inhibit our ability to accurately report our financial condition or operating results. If we are unable to\\nconclude that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, or if we or our independent registered public accounting firm determines we have a material\\nweakness in our internal control over financial reporting, we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, the market\\nprice of our common stock could decline, and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the stock exchange on which our securities are listed, the SEC\\nor other regulatory authorities. Failure to remedy any material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, or to implement or maintain these and other\\neffective control systems, could also restrict our future access to the capital markets.\\nITEM 1B.

PROPERTIES\\nAs of December\\xa031, 2022, we leased and owned office facilities around the world totaling 9.2 million square feet, including 2.3 million square feet for our\\ncorporate headquarters in the San Francisco Bay Area, California.\\nWe believe our facilities, which are generally used by all of our reportable segments, are adequate and suitable for our current needs and that should it be\\nneeded, suitable additional or alternative space will be available to accommodate our operations.\\nITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\\nWe are a party to various legal actions and government investigations, and similar or other actions could be brought against us in the future. The most\\nsignificant of these matters are described below.\\nLegal Proceedings Described in Note 14 – Commitments and Contingencies to Our Consolidated Financial Statements\\nNote 14 – Commitments and Contingencies to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December\\xa031, 2022 contained in this Annual Report on\\nForm 10-K includes information on legal proceedings that constitute material contingencies for financial reporting purposes that could have a material adverse\\neffect on our consolidated financial position, liquidity or results of operations if they were resolved in a manner that is adverse to us. This item should be read in\\nconjunction with Note 14 for information regarding the following material legal proceedings, which information is incorporated into this item by reference:\\n•\\nDriver Classification\\n•\\nState Unemployment Taxes\\nLegal Proceedings That Are Not Described in Note 14 – Commitments and Contingencies to Our Consolidated Financial Statements\\nIn addition to the matters that are identified in Note 14 – Commitments and Contingencies to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended\\nDecember\\xa031, 2022 contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and incorporated into this item by reference, the following matters also constitute material\\npending legal proceedings, other than ordinary course litigation incidental to our business, to which we are or any of our subsidiaries is a party.\\nAustralia Class Actions\\nIn May 2019, an Australian law firm filed a class action in the Supreme Court of Victoria, Australia, against us and certain of our subsidiaries, on behalf of\\ncertain participants in the taxi, hire-car, and limousine industries. The plaintiff alleges that the Uber entities conspired to injure the group members during the\\nperiod 2014 to 2017 by either directly breaching transport legislation or commissioning offenses against transport legislation by UberX Drivers in Australia. The\\nclaim alleges, in effect, that these operations caused loss and damage to the class representative and class members, including lost income and decreased value of\\ncertain taxi licenses. In March, April and October 2020, the same Australian law firm filed four additional class action lawsuits alleging the same claim. We deny\\nthese allegations and intend to continue to vigorously defend against the lawsuits. A trial has been scheduled to commence in February 2024.\\nOther Legal Proceedings\\nWhile it is not possible to determine the outcome of the legal actions, investigations, and proceedings brought against us, we believe that, except for the\\nmatters described above, the resolution of all such matters will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or liquidity, but could be\\nmaterial to our consolidated results of operations in any one accounting period. We are currently involved in, and may in the future be involved in, legal\\nproceedings, litigation, claims, and government investigations in the ordinary course of business. In addition, the nature of our business exposes us to claims related\\nto the classification of Drivers and the compliance of our business with applicable law. This risk is enhanced in certain jurisdictions outside\\n45\\nthe United States where we may be less protected under local laws than we are in the United States. Although the results of the legal proceedings, claims, and\\ngovernment investigations in which we are involved cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not believe that the final outcome of these matters is reasonably\\nlikely to have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or operating results. Regardless of final outcomes, however, any such legal\\nproceedings, claims, and government investigations may nonetheless impose a significant burden on management and employees and may come with costly\\ndefense costs or unfavorable preliminary and interim rulings.\\nITEM 4. MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES\\nNot applicable.\\nPART II\\nITEM 5. MARKET FOR REGISTRANT’S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY\\nSECURITIES\\nMarket Information for Common Stock\\nOur common stock has been listed on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) under the symbol “UBER” since May\\xa010, 2019. Prior to that date, there was\\nno public trading market for our common stock.\\nHolders of our Common Stock\\nAs of February\\xa015, 2023, there were\\xa01,457 holders of record of our common stock. The actual number of stockholders is greater than this number of record\\nholders and includes stockholders who are beneficial owners but whose shares are held in street name by brokers and other nominees.\\nDividend Policy\\nWe have never declared or paid cash dividends on our capital stock. We intend to retain all available funds and future earnings, if any, to fund the development\\nand expansion of our business, and we do not anticipate declaring or paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. The terms of certain of our outstanding\\ndebt instruments restrict our ability to pay dividends or make distributions on our common stock, and we may enter into credit agreements or other borrowing\\narrangements in the future that will restrict our ability to declare or pay cash dividends or make distributions on our capital stock. Any future determination\\nregarding the declaration and payment of dividends, if any, will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on then-existing conditions, including\\nour financial condition, operating results, contractual restrictions, capital requirements, business prospects, and other factors our board of directors may deem\\nrelevant.\\nUnregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds\\nUnregistered Sales of Equity Securities\\nIn November 2022, we issued 72 shares of our common stock to holders of Careem Convertible Notes who elected to convert the balance of such notes to\\ncommon stock at a conversion price of $55 per share. The shares were exempt from registration pursuant to Regulation S of the Securities Act.\\nPerformance Graph\\nThis performance graph shall not be deemed “soliciting material” or to be “filed” with the SEC for purposes of Section 18 of the Exchange Act, or otherwise\\nsubject to the liabilities under that Section, and shall not be deemed to be incorporated by reference into any filing of Uber Technologies, Inc. under the\\xa0Securities\\nAct, or the\\xa0Exchange Act.\\nThe following graph compares the cumulative total return to stockholders on our common stock relative to the cumulative total returns of the Standard &\\nPoor’s 500 Index, (“S&P 500”), and the S&P 500 Information Technology Sector\\xa0 Index (“S&P 500 IT”). An investment of $100 (with reinvestment of all\\ndividends) is assumed to have been made in our common stock and in each index on May\\xa010, 2019, the date our common stock began trading on the NYSE, and its\\nrelative performance is tracked through December\\xa031, 2022. The returns shown are based on historical results and are not intended to suggest future performance.\\n46\\nITEM 6. [RESERVED]\\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial\\nstatements and the related notes included\\xa0in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We have\\nelected to omit discussion on the earliest of the three years covered by the consolidated financial statements presented. Refer to Item 7. Management\\'s Discussion\\nand Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations located in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021, filed on\\nFebruary 24, 2022, for reference to discussion of the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020, the earliest of the three fiscal years presented.\\nIn addition to our historical consolidated financial information, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates,\\nand beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. You should review the sections titled “Special Note\\nRegarding Forward-Looking Statements” for a discussion of forward-looking statements and in Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors”, for a discussion of factors that\\ncould cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and\\nanalysis and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\\nOverview\\nWe are a technology platform that uses a massive network, leading technology, operational excellence, and product expertise to power movement from point A\\nto point B. We develop and operate proprietary technology applications supporting a variety of offerings on our platform. We connect consumers with providers of\\nride services, merchants as well as delivery service providers for meal preparation, grocery and other delivery services. Uber also connects consumers with public\\ntransportation networks. We use this same network, technology, operational excellence, and product expertise to connect Shippers with Carriers in the freight\\nindustry by providing Carriers with the ability to book a shipment, transportation management and other logistics services. We are also developing technologies\\ndesigned to provide new solutions to everyday problems.\\nDriver Classification Developments\\nThe classification of Drivers is currently being challenged in courts, by legislators and by government agencies in the United States and abroad. We are\\ninvolved in numerous legal proceedings globally, including putative class and collective class action lawsuits, demands for arbitration, charges and claims before\\nadministrative agencies, and investigations or audits by labor, social security, and tax authorities that claim that Drivers should be treated as our employees (or as\\nworkers or quasi-employees where those statuses exist), rather than as independent contractors. Of particular note are proceedings in California, where on May 5,\\n2020, the California Attorney General, in conjunction with the city attorneys for San Francisco, Los Angeles and San Diego, filed a complaint in San Francisco\\nSuperior Court (the “Court”) against Uber and Lyft, Inc., alleging that drivers are misclassified, and sought an injunction and monetary damages related to the\\nalleged competitive advantage caused by the alleged misclassification of drivers.\\n47\\nOn August 10, 2020, the Court issued a preliminary injunction order prohibiting us from classifying Drivers as independent contractors and from violating\\nvarious wage and hour laws. Following a stay of the injunction and our unsuccessful appeal of the injunction to a Court of Appeal, we were ordered to comply with\\nthe preliminary injunction. In November 2020, California voters approved Proposition 22, a state ballot initiative that provides a framework for drivers that use\\nplatforms like ours for independent work. Proposition 22 went into effect in December 2020. Although our stipulation to dissolve the California Attorney General’s\\npreliminary injunction was granted in April 2021, that litigation remains pending, and we also may face liability relating to periods before the effective date of\\nProposition 22.\\nIn January 2021, a petition was filed with the California Supreme Court by several drivers and a labor union alleging that Proposition 22 is unconstitutional,\\nwhich was denied. The same drivers and labor union have since filed a similar challenge in California Superior Court, and in August 2021, the Alameda County\\nSuperior Court ruled that Proposition 22 is unconstitutional. On September 21, 2021, the State of California filed an appeal of that decision with the California\\nCourt of Appeal, and the Protect App-Based Drivers and Services organization, who intervened in the matter, has also filed an appeal. Oral argument was heard and\\nwe await a decision.\\nTo comply with Proposition 22, we have incurred and expect to incur additional expenses, including expenses associated with a guaranteed minimum earnings\\nfloor for Drivers, insurance for injury protection and subsidies for health care. We do not expect these changes will have a material impact on our business, results\\nof operations, financial position, or cash flows.\\nAlso of note, on October 28, 2015, a claim by 25 Drivers, including Mr. Y. Aslam and Mr. J. Farrar, was brought in the United Kingdom (“UK”) Employment\\nTribunal against us asserting that they should be classified as “workers” (a separate category between independent contractors and employees) in the UK rather\\nthan independent contractors. The tribunal ruled on October 28, 2016 that the Drivers were workers whenever our App is switched on and they are ready and able\\nto take trips, based on an assessment of the App in July 2016. The Court of Appeal rejected our appeal in a majority decision on December 19, 2018. We appealed\\nto the Supreme Court and a hearing at the Supreme Court took place in July 2020.\\nOn February 19, 2021, the Supreme Court of the UK upheld the tribunal ruling. Subsequently, we initiated a historical claims settlement process for UK\\ndrivers. Damages may include back pay including holiday pay and minimum wage. Additional claimants have also filed and each claimant will be required to bring\\ntheir own separate action to an employment tribunal to determine whether they met the “worker” classification and if so, how much each claimant will be awarded.\\nOn March 16, 2021, we announced that more than 70,000 drivers in the UK will be treated as workers, earning at least the National Living Wage when driving\\nwith Uber. They will also be paid for holiday time and all those eligible will be automatically enrolled into a pension plan. We have also completed a settlement\\nprocess with drivers in the UK to proactively resolve historical claims relating to their classification under UK law. Our portal for drivers to register for a settlement\\nof historical holiday pay and national minimum wage liabilities closed on July 22, 2021 and we have extended offers to all drivers eligible for settlement who are\\nnot already represented by an attorney and have made payments to the drivers who accepted our offers. Compensation hearings will take place for claimants who\\nhave not settled their historic claims, where the tribunal will assess our position on the correct approach to working time, expenses, and holiday pay.\\nOn June 23, 2021, we received a compliance notice from the UK pension regulator to facilitate our auto-enrollment implementation. We have completed the\\nenrollment of eligible drivers in the UK into a pension plan.\\nIf, as a result of legislation or judicial decisions, we are required to classify Drivers as employees, workers or quasi-employees where those statuses exist, we\\nwould incur significant additional expenses for compensating Drivers, including expenses associated with the application of wage and hour laws (including\\nminimum wage, overtime, and meal and rest period requirements), employee benefits, social security contributions, taxes (direct and indirect), and potential\\npenalties. Additionally, we may not have adequate Driver supply as Drivers may opt out of our platform given the loss of flexibility under an employment model,\\nand we may not be able to hire a majority of the Drivers currently using our platform. Any of these events could negatively impact our business, result of\\noperations, financial position, and cash flows.\\nFor a discussion of risk factors related to how misclassification challenges may impact our business, result of operations, financial position and operating\\ncondition and cash flows, see the risk factor titled “-Our business would be adversely affected if Drivers were classified as employees, workers or quasi-\\nemployees” included in Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors”, and Note 14 – Commitments and Contingencies to our consolidated financial statements included in Part\\nII, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\\nIn addition, if we are required to classify Drivers as employees, this may impact our current financial statement presentation including revenue, cost of\\nrevenue, incentives and promotions as further described in Note 1 – Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the notes to the\\nconsolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” and the section titled “Critical Accounting\\nEstimates” in Part II, Item 7, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\\n48\\nFinancial and Operational Highlights\\nYear Ended December 31,\\nConstant Currency \\n(In millions, except percentages)\\n2021\\n2022\\n2021 to 2022 %\\nChange\\n2021 to 2022 % Change\\nMonthly Active Platform Consumers (“MAPCs”) \\n118\\n131\\n11\\xa0%\\nTrips \\n6,368\\n7,642\\n20\\xa0%\\nGross Bookings \\n$\\n90,415\\xa0\\n$\\n115,395\\xa0\\n28\\xa0%\\n33\\xa0%\\nRevenue\\n$\\n17,455\\xa0\\n$\\n31,877\\xa0\\n83\\xa0%\\n90\\xa0%\\nNet loss attributable to Uber Technologies, Inc. \\n$\\n(496)\\n$\\n(9,141)\\n**\\nMobility Adjusted EBITDA\\n$\\n1,596\\xa0\\n$\\n3,299\\xa0\\n107\\xa0%\\nDelivery Adjusted EBITDA\\n$\\n(348)\\n$\\n551\\xa0\\n**\\nAdjusted EBITDA \\n$\\n(774)\\n$\\n1,713\\xa0\\n**\\nNet cash provided by (used in) operating activities \\n$\\n(445)\\n$\\n642\\xa0\\n**\\nFree cash flow \\n$\\n(743)\\n$\\n390\\xa0\\n**\\n See the section titled “Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for more information and reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP\\nfinancial measure.\\n See the section titled “Certain Key Metrics and Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below for more information.\\n MAPCs presented for annual periods are MAPCs for the fourth quarter of the year.\\n Net loss attributable to Uber Technologies, Inc. included stock-based compensation expense of $1.2 billion and $1.8 billion during the years ended\\nDecember 31, 2021 and 2022, respectively.\\n Net cash used in operating activities and free cash flow during the year ended December 31, 2021 reflected a $1.0\\xa0billion cash inflow related to a legacy\\nauto insurance transfer. For additional information on the legacy auto insurance transfer, refer to Note 1 – Description of Business and Summary of Significant\\nAccounting Policies to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” of this Annual Report on\\nForm 10-K as well as the section titled “Liquidity and Capital Resources” for more information.\\nNet cash provided by operating activities and free cash flow during the year ended December 31, 2022 reflected an approximately $733 million (GBP 613\\nmillion) cash outflow related to the resolution of all outstanding HMRC VAT claims that were paid during the fourth quarter of 2022. For additional information on\\nthis matter, refer to Note 14 – Commitments and Contingencies to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and\\nSupplementary Data,” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K as well as the section titled “Liquidity and Capital Resources”.\\n** Percentage not meaningful.\\nHighlights for 2022\\nIn the fourth quarter of 2022, our MAPCs were 131 million, growing 7 million, or 6%, quarter-over-quarter, and growing 11% compared to the same period in\\n2021.\\nOverall Gross Bookings increased by $25.0 billion in 2022, up 28%, or 33% on a constant currency basis, compared to 2021. Mobility Gross Bookings grew\\n48% year-over-year, on a constant currency basis, primarily due to increases in Trip volumes as the business recovers from the impacts of the coronavirus pandemic\\n(“COVID-19”). Delivery Gross Bookings grew 14% year-over-year, on a constant currency basis, primarily driven by growth in the US & Canada. Freight Gross\\nBookings grew 226% year-over-year, on a constant currency basis, primarily attributable to the acquisition of Tupelo Parent, Inc. (“Transplace”) in the fourth\\nquarter of 2021.\\nRevenue was $31.9 billion, or up 83% year-over-year. Revenue growth outpaced Gross Bookings growth primarily due to a $4.8\\xa0billion increase in our Freight\\nbusiness primarily due to the acquisition of Transplace during the fourth quarter of 2021, the net favorable impact to Mobility revenue of $3.9 billion as a result of\\nbusiness model changes in the UK and accruals made for the resolution of historical claims in the UK relating to the classification of drivers, and an $892 million\\nincrease in Delivery revenue resulting from an increase in certain Courier payments and incentives that are recorded in cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation\\nand amortization, for certain markets where we are primarily responsible for Delivery services and pay Couriers for services provided.\\nNet loss attributable to Uber Technologies, Inc. was $9.1 billion, which includes the unfavorable impact of a pre-tax unrealized loss on debt and equity\\nsecurities, net, of $7.0 billion primarily related to changes in the fair value of our marketable equity securities, including: a $3.0 billion net unrealized loss on our\\nAurora investments, a $2.1 billion net unrealized loss on our Grab investment, a $1.0 billion net unrealized loss on our Didi investment, a $747 million change of\\nfair value on our Zomato investment, as well as a\\n(1)\\n(2), (3)\\n(2)\\n(2)\\n(4)\\n(1), (2)\\n(5)\\n(1), (5)\\n(1)\\n(2)\\n(3)\\n(4)\\n(5)\\n49\\n$142 million net unrealized loss on other investments. Net loss attributable to Uber Technologies, Inc. also included $1.8 billion of stock-based compensation\\nexpense.\\nAdjusted EBITDA was $1.7 billion, growing $2.5 billion compared to 2021. Mobility Adjusted EBITDA profit was $3.3 billion, up $1.7 billion compared to\\n2021. Delivery Adjusted EBITDA profit was $551 million, up $899 million from Delivery Adjusted EBITDA loss of $348 million in 2021.\\nWe ended the year with $4.3 billion in unrestricted cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments.\\nOther Developments\\nCOVID-19\\nCOVID-19 rapidly changed market and economic conditions globally, impacting Drivers, Merchants, consumers and business partners, as well as our business,\\nresults of operations, financial position, and cash flows. Various governmental restrictions, including the declaration of a federal National Emergency, multiple\\ncities’ and states’ declarations of states of emergency, school and business closings, quarantines, restrictions on travel, limitations on social or public gatherings,\\nand other measures have, and may continue to have, an adverse impact on our business and operations. For example, we temporarily suspended our shared rides\\noffering globally, and continue to offer “leave at door” delivery options for Delivery offerings. We also responded to COVID-19 by launching new, or expanding\\nexisting, services or features on an expedited basis, particularly those related to delivery of food and other goods.\\nFurthermore, we have experienced, and may continue to experience, Driver supply constraints. For a discussion of the potential impacts of COVID-19 on our\\nbusiness, results of operations, financial position, and cash flows refer to Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\\nComponents of Results of Operations\\nRevenue\\nWe generate substantially all of our revenue from fees paid by Drivers and Merchants for use of our platform. We have concluded that we are an agent in these\\narrangements as we arrange for other parties to provide the service to the end-user. Under this model, revenue is net of Driver and Merchant earnings and Driver\\nincentives. We act as an agent in these transactions by connecting consumers to Drivers and Merchants to facilitate a Trip, meal or grocery delivery service.\\nIn 2022, we modified our arrangements in certain markets and, as a result, concluded we are responsible for the provision of Mobility services to end-users in\\nthose markets. We have determined that in these transactions, end-users are our customers and our sole performance obligation in the transaction is to provide\\ntransportation services to the end-user. We recognize revenue when a trip is complete. In these markets where we are responsible for Mobility services, we present\\nrevenue from end-users on a gross basis, as we control the service provided by Drivers to end-users, while payments to Drivers in exchange for Mobility services\\nare recognized in cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization.\\nFor additional discussion related to our revenue, see the section titled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of\\nOperations - Critical Accounting Estimates - Revenue Recognition,” “Note 1 – Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Revenue\\nRecognition,” and “Note 2 – Revenue” to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” of this\\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K.\\nCost of Revenue, Exclusive of Depreciation and Amortization\\nCost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, primarily consists of certain insurance costs related to our Mobility and Delivery offerings, credit\\ncard processing fees, bank fees, data center and networking expenses, mobile device and service costs, costs incurred with Carriers for Uber Freight transportation\\nservices, amounts related to fare chargebacks and other credit card losses as well as costs incurred for certain Mobility and Delivery transactions where we are\\nprimarily responsible for Mobility or Delivery services and pay Drivers and Couriers for services.\\nWe expect that cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, will fluctuate on an absolute dollar basis for the foreseeable future in line with Trip\\nvolume changes on the platform. As Trips increase or decrease, we expect related changes for insurance costs, credit card processing fees, hosting and co-located\\ndata center expenses, maps license fees, and other cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization.\\nOperations and Support\\nOperations and support expenses primarily consist of compensation expenses, including stock-based compensation, for employees that support operations in\\ncities, including the general managers, Driver operations, platform user support representatives and community managers. Also included is the cost of customer\\nsupport, Driver background checks and the allocation of certain corporate costs.\\nAs our business recovers from the impacts of COVID-19 and Trip volume increases, we would expect operations and support expenses to increase on an\\nabsolute dollar basis for the foreseeable future, but decrease as a percentage of revenue as we become more efficient in supporting platform users.\\n50\\nSales and Marketing\\nSales and marketing expenses primarily consist of compensation costs, including stock-based compensation to sales and marketing employees, advertising\\ncosts, product marketing costs and discounts, loyalty programs, promotions, refunds, and credits provided to end-users who are not customers, and the allocation of\\ncertain corporate costs. We expense advertising and other promotional expenditures as incurred.\\nAs our business recovers from the impacts of COVID-19, we would anticipate sales and marketing expenses to increase on an absolute dollar basis for the\\nforeseeable future but vary from period to period as a percentage of revenue due to timing of marketing campaigns.\\nResearch and Development\\nResearch and development expenses primarily consist of compensation costs, including stock-based compensation, for employees in engineering, design and\\nproduct development. Expenses includes ATG and Other Technology Programs development expenses prior to the divestiture of our ATG business in January 2021,\\nas well as expenses associated with ongoing improvements to, and maintenance of, existing products and services, and allocation of certain corporate costs. We\\nexpense substantially all research and development expenses as incurred.\\nWe expect research and development expenses to increase and vary from period to period as a percentage of revenue as we continue to invest in research and\\ndevelopment activities relating to ongoing improvements to and maintenance of our platform offerings and other research and development programs, offset by a\\ndecrease in investments in our ATG and Other Technology Programs subsequent to the sale of our ATG Business in 2021.\\nGeneral and Administrative\\nGeneral and administrative expenses primarily consist of compensation costs, including stock-based compensation, for executive management and\\nadministrative employees, including finance and accounting, human resources, policy and communications, legal, and certain impairment charges, as well as\\nallocation of certain corporate costs, occupancy, and general corporate insurance costs. General and administrative expenses also include certain legal settlements.\\nAs our business recovers from the impacts of COVID-19 and Trip volume increases, we expect that general and administrative expenses will increase on an\\nabsolute dollar basis for the foreseeable future, but decrease as a percentage of revenue as we achieve improved fixed cost leverage and efficiencies in our internal\\nsupport functions.\\nDepreciation and Amortization\\nDepreciation and amortization expenses primarily consist of depreciation on buildings, site improvements, computer and network equipment, software,\\nleasehold improvements, furniture and fixtures, and amortization of intangible assets. Depreciation includes expenses associated with buildings, site improvements,\\ncomputer and network equipment, leased vehicles, and furniture, fixtures, as well as leasehold improvements. Amortization includes expenses associated with our\\ncapitalized internal-use software and acquired intangible assets.\\nInterest Expense\\nInterest expense consists primarily of interest expense associated with our outstanding debt, including accretion of debt discount. For additional detail related\\nto our debt obligations, see “Note 8 – Long-Term Debt and Revolving Credit Arrangements” to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8,\\n“Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\\nOther Income (Expense), Net\\nOther income (expense), net primarily includes the following items:\\n•\\nInterest income, which consists primarily of interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash and cash equivalents.\\n•\\nForeign currency exchange gains (losses), net, which consist primarily of remeasurement of transactions and monetary assets and liabilities denominated\\nin currencies other than the functional currency at the end of the period.\\n•\\nGain on business divestitures, net.\\n•\\nGain from sale of investments, which consists primarily of gain from the sale of our entire equity interest in the Yandex Self Driving Group B.V. (“SDG”),\\nand the derecognition of our entire equity interest in the Demerged Businesses in 2021. For additional information, see “Note 4 - Equity Method\\nInvestments” to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” of this Annual Report\\non Form 10-K.\\n•\\nUnrealized gain (loss) on debt and equity securities, net, which consists primarily of gains (losses) from fair value adjustments relating to our marketable\\nand non-marketable securities.\\n51\\n•\\nImpairment of equity method investment.\\n•\\nRevaluation of MLU B.V. call option, which represents changes in fair value recorded on the call option granted to Yandex (“MLU B.V.

For more information about how we use these non-GAAP\\nfinancial measures in our business, the limitations of these measures, and reconciliations of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial\\nmeasures, see the section titled “Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures.”\\nMonthly Active Platform Consumers. MAPCs is the number of unique consumers who completed a Mobility or New Mobility ride or received a Delivery\\norder on our platform at least once in a given month, averaged over each month in the quarter. While a unique consumer can use multiple product offerings on our\\nplatform in a given month, that unique consumer is counted as only one MAPC. We use MAPCs to assess the adoption of our platform and frequency of\\ntransactions, which are key factors in our penetration of the countries in which we operate.\\nTrips. We define Trips as the number of completed consumer Mobility or New Mobility rides and Delivery orders in a given period. For example, an UberX\\nShare ride with three paying consumers represents three unique Trips, whereas an UberX ride with three passengers represents one Trip. We believe that Trips are a\\nuseful metric to measure the scale and usage of our platform.\\n58\\nGross Bookings. We define Gross Bookings as the total dollar value, including any applicable taxes, tolls, and fees, of: Mobility rides; Delivery orders (in each\\ncase without any adjustment for consumer discounts and refunds); Driver and Merchant earnings; Driver incentives and Freight revenue. Gross Bookings do not\\ninclude tips earned by Drivers. Gross Bookings are an indication of the scale of our current platform, which ultimately impacts revenue.\\n(In millions)\\nQ1 2021\\nQ2 2021\\nQ3 2021\\nQ4 2021\\nQ1 2022\\nQ2 2022\\nQ3 2022\\nQ4 2022\\nMobility\\n$\\n6,773\\xa0\\n$\\n8,640\\xa0\\n$\\n9,883\\xa0\\n$\\n11,340\\xa0\\n$\\n10,723\\xa0 $\\n13,364\\xa0 $\\n13,684\\xa0 $\\n14,894\\xa0\\nDelivery\\n12,461\\xa0\\n12,912\\xa0\\n12,828\\xa0\\n13,444\\xa0\\n13,903\\xa0\\n13,876\\xa0\\n13,684\\xa0\\n14,315\\xa0\\nFreight\\n302\\xa0\\n348\\xa0\\n402\\xa0\\n1,082\\xa0\\n1,823\\xa0\\n1,838\\xa0\\n1,751\\xa0\\n1,540\\xa0\\nTake Rate is defined as revenue as a percentage of Gross Bookings.\\nAdjusted EBITDA.

In addition to revenue, net income\\n(loss), income (loss) from operations, and other results under GAAP, we use Adjusted EBITDA, revenue growth rates in constant currency and free cash flow,\\nwhich are described below, to evaluate our business. We use these non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to\\nevaluate period-to-period comparisons. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our\\nperformance by excluding certain items that may not be indicative of our recurring core business operating results.\\nWe believe that both management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing our performance and when\\nplanning, forecasting, and analyzing future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate management’s internal comparisons to our historical\\nperformance. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors both because (1) they allow for greater transparency with respect to key\\nmetrics used by management in its financial and operational decision-making and (2) they are used by our institutional investors and the analyst community to help\\nthem analyze the health of our business. Accordingly, we believe that these\\xa0non-GAAP\\xa0financial measures provide useful information to investors and others in\\nunderstanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management team and board of directors. Our calculation of these\\xa0 non-\\nGAAP\\xa0financial measures may differ from similarly-titled\\xa0non-GAAP\\xa0measures, if any, reported by our peer\\n59\\ncompanies. These\\xa0non-GAAP\\xa0financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as substitutes for, financial information prepared in accordance with\\nGAAP.\\nAdjusted EBITDA\\nWe define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss), excluding (i) income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of income taxes, (ii) net income (loss)\\nattributable to non-controlling interests, net of tax, (iii)\\xa0provision for (benefit from) income taxes, (iv) income (loss) from equity method investments, (v) interest\\nexpense, (vi) other income (expense), net, (vii) depreciation and amortization, (viii) stock-based compensation expense, (ix) certain legal, tax, and regulatory\\nreserve changes and settlements, (x) goodwill and asset impairments/loss on sale of assets, (xi) acquisition, financing and divestitures related expenses, (xii)\\nrestructuring and related charges and (xiii) other items not indicative of our ongoing operating performance, including COVID-19 response initiatives related\\npayments for financial assistance to Drivers personally impacted by COVID-19, the cost of personal protective equipment distributed to Drivers, Driver\\nreimbursement for their cost of purchasing personal protective equipment, the costs related to free rides and food deliveries to healthcare workers, seniors, and\\nothers in need as well as charitable donations.\\nWe have included Adjusted EBITDA in this Annual Report on Form 10-K because it is a key measure used by our management team to evaluate our operating\\nperformance, generate future operating plans, and make strategic decisions, including those relating to operating expenses. Accordingly, we believe that Adjusted\\nEBITDA provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management team\\nand board of directors. In addition, it provides a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of our business, as it removes the effect of certain non-cash\\nexpenses and certain variable charges. To help our board, management and investors assess the impact of COVID-19 on our results of operations, we are excluding\\nthe impacts of COVID-19 response initiatives related payments for financial assistance to Drivers personally impacted by COVID-19, the cost of personal\\nprotective equipment distributed to Drivers, Driver reimbursement for their cost of purchasing personal protective equipment, the costs related to free rides and\\nfood deliveries to healthcare workers, seniors, and others in need as well as charitable donations from Adjusted EBITDA. Our board and management find the\\nexclusion of the impact of these COVID-19 response initiatives from Adjusted EBITDA to be useful because it allows us and our investors to assess the impact of\\nthese response initiatives on our results of operations.\\nCOVID-19 Response Initiatives\\nTo support those whose earning opportunities have been depressed as a result of COVID-19, as well as communities hit hard by the pandemic, we have\\nannounced and implemented several initiatives, including, in particular, payments for financial assistance to Drivers personally impacted by COVID-19, the cost of\\npersonal protective equipment distributed to Drivers, Driver reimbursement for their cost of purchasing personal protective equipment, the costs related to free\\nrides and food deliveries to healthcare workers, seniors, and others in need as well as charitable donations. The payments for financial assistance to Drivers\\npersonally impacted by COVID-19 and Driver reimbursement for their cost of purchasing personal protective equipment are recorded as a reduction to revenue.\\nThe cost of personal protective equipment distributed to Drivers, the costs related to free rides and food deliveries to healthcare workers, seniors, and others in need\\nas well as charitable donations are recorded as an expense in our costs and expenses.\\nLimitations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Adjusted EBITDA Reconciliation\\nAdjusted EBITDA has limitations as a financial measure, should be considered as supplemental in nature, and is not meant as a substitute for the related\\nfinancial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. These limitations include the following:\\n•\\nAdjusted EBITDA excludes certain recurring, non-cash charges, such as depreciation of property and equipment and amortization of intangible assets, and\\nalthough these are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future, and Adjusted EBITDA does not\\nreflect all cash capital expenditure requirements for such replacements or for new capital expenditure requirements;\\n•\\nAdjusted EBITDA excludes stock-based compensation expense, which has been, and will continue to be for the foreseeable future, a significant recurring\\nexpense in our business and an important part of our compensation strategy;\\n•\\nAdjusted EBITDA excludes certain restructuring and related charges, part of which may be settled in cash;\\n•\\nAdjusted EBITDA excludes other items not indicative of our ongoing operating performance, including COVID-19 response initiatives related payments\\nfor financial assistance to Drivers personally impacted by COVID-19, the cost of personal protective equipment distributed to Drivers, Driver\\nreimbursement for their cost of purchasing personal protective equipment, the costs related to free rides and food deliveries to healthcare workers, seniors,\\nand others in need as well as charitable donations;\\n•\\nAdjusted EBITDA does not reflect period to period changes in taxes, income tax expense or the cash necessary to pay income taxes;\\n•\\nAdjusted EBITDA does not reflect the components of other income (expense), net, which primarily includes: interest income; foreign currency exchange\\ngains (losses), net; gain (loss) on business divestitures, net; and unrealized gain (loss) on debt and equity securities, net; and impairment of debt and equity\\nsecurities; and\\n60\\n•\\nAdjusted EBITDA excludes certain legal, tax, and regulatory reserve changes and settlements that may reduce cash available to us.\\n\\xa0The following table presents a reconciliation of net loss attributable to Uber Technologies, Inc., the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, to\\nAdjusted EBITDA for each of the periods indicated:\\nYear Ended December 31,\\n(In millions)\\n2021\\n2022\\nAdjusted EBITDA reconciliation:\\nNet loss attributable to Uber Technologies, Inc.\\n$\\n(496)\\n$\\n(9,141)\\nAdd (deduct):\\nNet income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interests, net of tax\\n(74)\\n3\\xa0\\nProvision for (benefit from) income taxes\\n(492)\\n(181)\\n(Income) loss from equity method investments\\n37\\xa0\\n(107)\\nInterest expense\\n483\\xa0\\n565\\xa0\\nOther (income) expense, net\\n(3,292)\\n7,029\\xa0\\nDepreciation and amortization\\n902\\xa0\\n947\\xa0\\nStock-based compensation expense\\n1,168\\xa0\\n1,793\\xa0\\nLegal, tax, and regulatory reserve changes and settlements\\n526\\xa0\\n732\\xa0\\nGoodwill and asset impairments/loss on sale of assets\\n157\\xa0\\n25\\xa0\\nAcquisition, financing and divestitures related expenses\\n102\\xa0\\n46\\xa0\\nAccelerated lease costs related to cease-use of ROU assets\\n5\\xa0\\n6\\xa0\\nCOVID-19 response initiatives\\n54\\xa0\\n1\\xa0\\nLoss on lease arrangement, net\\n—\\xa0\\n7\\xa0\\nRestructuring and related charges, net\\n—\\xa0\\n2\\xa0\\nLegacy auto insurance transfer \\n103\\xa0\\n—\\xa0\\nMass arbitration fees, net\\n43\\xa0\\n(14)\\nAdjusted EBITDA\\n$\\n(774)\\n$\\n1,713\\xa0\\n For further information, refer to Note 1 – Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the notes to the consolidated financial\\nstatements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\\nConstant Currency\\nWe compare the percent change in\\xa0our\\xa0current period\\xa0results\\xa0from\\xa0the corresponding prior period\\xa0using constant currency disclosure.

The decrease in cash consumed by\\nworking capital was primarily driven by an increase in our insurance reserves and accrued expenses and other current liabilities, partially offset by higher accounts\\nreceivable. Net cash provided by operating activities reflects a cash outflow of approximately $733 million (GBP 613 million) related to the resolution of\\noutstanding HMRC VAT claims that were paid during the fourth quarter of 2022. For additional information on this matter, refer to Note 14 – Commitments and\\nContingencies to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” of this Annual Report on Form\\n10-K.\\nNet cash used in operating activities was $445 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily consisting of $570 million of net loss, adjusted for\\ncertain non-cash items, which primarily included $1.7 billion in gain on business divestitures, $1.2 billion of stock-based compensation expense, $1.1 billion of\\nunrealized gain on debt and equity securities, $413 million of gain from sale of investments, depreciation and amortization expense of $902 million, as well as a\\n$477 million decrease in cash consumed by working capital. The decrease in cash consumed by working capital and other operating activities was primarily driven\\nby an increase in accrued expenses and other liabilities, an increase in our insurance reserves, partially offset by higher accounts receivable and prepaid expenses\\nand lower operating lease liabilities. Net cash used in operating activities also reflects a $1.0\\xa0billion cash inflow related to legacy auto insurance transfer. For\\nadditional information on the legacy auto insurance transfer, see Note 1 – Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies included in Part\\nII, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\\nInvesting Activities\\nNet cash used in investing activities was $1.6 billion for the year ended December 31, 2022, primarily consisting of $1.7 billion in purchases of marketable\\nsecurities, $252 million in purchases of property and equipment, and $59 million in acquisition of business, net of cash acquired, partially offset by proceeds from\\nmaturities and sales of marketable securities of $376 million.\\nNet cash used in investing activities was $1.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily consisting of $2.3 billion in acquisition of businesses,\\nnet of cash acquired, $1.1 billion in purchases of marketable securities, $982 million in purchases of non-marketable equity securities, $297 million in purchases of\\nnotes receivable, and $298 million in purchases of property and equipment, partially offset by proceeds from maturities and sales of marketable securities of $2.3\\nbillion, proceeds from the sale of equity method investments of $1.0 billion and proceeds from sale of non-marketable equity securities of $500 million.\\nFinancing Activities\\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $15 million\\xa0for the year ended December 31, 2022, primarily consisting of proceeds from sale of subsidiary\\nstock units of $255 million, and proceeds from the issuance of common stock under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan of $92 million, partially offset by $184\\nmillion of principal payments on finance leases, and $80 million of principal repayment on the non-interest bearing unsecured convertible notes related to the\\nacquisition of Careem (“Careem Notes”).\\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $1.8 billion\\xa0 for the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily consisting of $1.5 billion of proceeds from\\nissuance of notes, net of issuance costs, $675 million of proceeds from issuance of subsidiary preferred stock units, partially offset by $307 million of principal\\nrepayment on Careem Notes and $226 million principal payments on finance leases.\\nOther Information\\nAs of December\\xa031, 2022, $2.4 billion of our $4.2 billion in cash and cash equivalents was held by our foreign subsidiaries. Cash held outside the United\\nStates may be repatriated, subject to certain limitations, and would be available to be used to fund our domestic operations. Repatriation of funds may result in\\nimmaterial tax liabilities. We believe that our existing cash balance in the\\n62\\nUnited States is sufficient to fund our working capital needs in the United States. We are in compliance with our debt and line of credit covenants as of\\nDecember\\xa031, 2022, including by meeting our reporting obligations. We also believe that our sources of funding and our available line of credit will be sufficient to\\nsatisfy our currently anticipated cash requirements including capital expenditures, working capital requirements, collateral requirements, potential acquisitions,\\npotential prepayments of contested indirect tax assessments (“pay-to-play”), and other liquidity requirements through at least the next 12 months. We intend to\\ncontinue to evaluate and may, in certain circumstances, take preemptive action to preserve liquidity.\\nNon-Income Tax Matters\\nOn October\\xa031, 2022, we resolved all outstanding HMRC (the tax regulator in the UK) VAT claims related to periods prior to our model change on March\\xa014,\\n2022. There was not a material impact to our statement of operations as we had adequate reserves recorded related to this resolution. During the fourth quarter of\\n2022, we made a payment of approximately $733 million (GBP 613\\xa0million) for this resolution. For additional information, see Note 14 – Commitments and\\nContingencies in the section titled “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\\nCommitments\\nLeases\\nOur operating lease portfolio primarily consists of corporate offices. For additional information, see Note 6 - Leases in the notes to the consolidated financial\\nstatements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\\nLong-Term Debt\\nWe have long-term debt with varying maturities dates through 2029. For additional information, see Note 8 – Long-Term Debt and Revolving Credit\\nArrangements in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” of this Annual\\nReport on Form 10-K.\\nPurchase Commitments\\nWe have non-cancelable commitments which primarily relate to network and cloud services and other items in the ordinary course of business. These amounts\\nare determined based on the non-cancelable quantities to which we are contractually obligated.\\nIn November 2022, we entered into commercial technology agreements with vendors for cloud computing services (“2022 Cloud Computing Service\\nAgreements”). We are committed to spend an aggregate of at least $2.9\\xa0billion through November 2029, of which $160 million is short-term. We may pay more\\nthan the minimum purchase commitment to our cloud-computing web services providers based on usage. As of December\\xa031, 2022, the amounts utilized for these\\nagreements are immaterial.\\nAs of December\\xa031, 2022, we had $3.2 billion in non-cancelable commitments, this includes the $2.9\\xa0billion in 2022 Cloud Computing Service Agreements\\ndiscussed above. The non-cancellable commitments have varying expiration terms through November 2029.\\nCritical Accounting Estimates\\nWe believe that the following accounting policies involve a high degree of judgment and complexity and are critical to understanding and evaluating our\\nconsolidated financial condition and results of our operations. An accounting policy is considered to be critical if it requires judgment on a significant accounting\\nestimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are uncertain at the time the estimate is made, and if different estimates that reasonably could have\\nbeen used, or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically, could materially impact the reported amounts of assets, liabilities,\\nrevenue and expenses, and related disclosures in our audited consolidated financial statements. We have based our estimates on historical experience and on various\\nother assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of\\nassets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Although we believe that the estimates we use are reasonable, due to the inherent uncertainty\\ninvolved in making those estimates, actual results reported in future periods could differ from those estimates.\\nWe believe that the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments, estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our\\nconsolidated financial statements. For additional information, see the disclosure included in Note 1 – Description of Business and Summary of Significant\\nAccounting Policies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” of this Annual\\nReport on Form 10-K.\\nRevenue Recognition\\nWe derive our revenue principally from service fees paid by Drivers and Merchants for the use of our platform in connection with our Mobility products and\\nDelivery offering provided by Drivers and Merchants to end-users. Our sole performance obligation in the transaction is to connect Drivers and Merchants with\\nend-users to facilitate the completion of a successful ridesharing trip or delivery. In certain markets, we also generate revenue from end-users and charge a direct\\nfee for use of the platform and in exchange for\\n63\\nMobility and Delivery services. With exception of these markets, end-users are not our customers because end-users access our platform for free and we have no\\nperformance obligation to end-users.\\nJudgment is required in evaluating the presentation of revenue on a gross versus net basis based on whether we control the service provided to the end-user and\\nare the principal in the transaction (gross), or we arrange for other parties to provide the service to the end-user and are the agent in the transaction (net). We have\\nconcluded that we are the agent in most markets as we arrange for Drivers and Merchants to provide the service to the end user in Mobility and Delivery\\ntransactions. The assessment of whether we are considered the principal or the agent in a transaction could impact the accounting for certain payments and\\nincentives provided to Drivers and end-users and change the timing and amount of revenue recognized.\\nIn certain markets, consumers have the option to pay Drivers cash for trips, and we generally collect our service fee from Drivers for these trips by offsetting\\nagainst any other amounts due to Drivers, including Driver incentives. We have concluded collectability of such amounts is not probable until collected. As such,\\nuncollected service fees for cash trips are not recognized as revenue in our consolidated financial statements until collected.\\nDriver Incentives\\nWe offer various incentive programs to Drivers. Judgment is required to determine the appropriate classification of these incentives. Incentives provided to\\ncustomers are recorded as a reduction of revenue if we do not receive a distinct service in exchange or cannot reasonably estimate the fair value of the service\\nreceived. Incentives offered in exchange for specific services, such as referral services are recorded as sales and marketing expenses.\\nEnd-User Discounts and Promotions\\nWe offer discounts and promotions to end-users (that are not customers) to encourage use of our platform. Judgment is required to determine the appropriate\\nclassification of these incentives. End-user discounts and promotions are recorded to sales and marketing expenses with the exception of market-wide promotions\\nwhich are recorded as a reduction of revenue.\\nBusiness Combinations\\nWe allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and intangible assets acquired based on their estimated\\nfair values. The excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. Such\\nvaluations require management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets. Significant estimates in valuing certain\\nintangible assets include, but are not limited to, future expected cash flows from acquired advertiser, fleet, merchant, and end-user contracts, acquired technology,\\nand trade names, based on expected future growth rates and margins, attrition rates, future changes in technology and royalty for similar brand licenses, useful\\nlives, and discount rates.\\nManagement\\'s estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a\\nresult, actual results may differ from estimates. Allocation of purchase consideration to identifiable assets and liabilities affects our amortization expense, as\\nacquired finite-lived intangible assets are amortized over the useful life, whereas any indefinite lived intangible assets, including goodwill, are not amortized.\\nDuring the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed,\\nwith the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to earnings.\\nInvestments—Non-Marketable Equity and Debt Securities\\nWe hold investments in privately held companies in the form of equity securities and debt securities without readily determinable fair values and in which we\\ndo not have a controlling interest or significant influence. Investments in equity securities without readily determinable fair values are initially recorded at cost and\\nare subsequently adjusted to fair value for impairments and price changes from observable transactions in the same or a similar security from the same issuer.\\nInvestments in material available-for-sale debt securities are recorded initially at fair value and subsequently remeasured to fair value at each reporting date with\\nthe changes in fair value recognized in other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax. We may elect the fair value option for financial instruments and account for\\ninvestments in debt and equity securities at fair value with changes reported in net income (loss) from continuing operations.\\nInvestments in privately held equity and debt securities are valued using significant unobservable inputs or data in inactive markets. This valuation requires\\njudgment due to the absence of market prices and inherent lack of liquidity and are classified as Level\\xa03 in the fair value hierarchy. In determining the estimated\\nfair value of our investments in privately held companies, we utilize the most recent data available including observed transactions such as equity financing\\ntransactions of the investees and sales of the existing shares of the investees’ securities. In addition, the determination of whether an observed transaction is similar\\nto the equity and debt securities held by us requires significant management judgment based on the rights and preferences of the securities.\\nWe assess our investment portfolio of privately held equity and debt securities quarterly for impairment. The impairment analysis for investments in equity\\nsecurities includes a qualitative analysis of factors including the investee’s financial performance, industry and market conditions, and other relevant factors. If an\\nequity investment is considered to be impaired we will establish a new carrying\\n64\\nvalue for the investment and recognize an impairment loss through our consolidated statement of operations. Investments in debt securities are evaluated for\\nimpairment quarterly based on whether its fair value has declined below its amortized cost. In circumstances where we intend to sell, or are more likely than not\\nrequired to sell the security before it recovers its amortized cost basis, the difference between the fair value and amortized cost is recognized as a loss in the\\nconsolidated financial statement of operations, with a corresponding write-down of the security’s amortized cost. In circumstances where neither condition exists,\\nwe then evaluate whether a decline is due to credit-related factors. The factors considered in determining whether a credit loss exists can include the extent to\\nwhich fair value is less than the amortized cost basis, changes in the credit quality of the underlying loan obligors, credit ratings actions, as well as other factors. To\\ndetermine the portion of a decline in fair value that is credit-related, we compare the present value of the expected cash flows of the security discounted at the\\nsecurity’s effective interest rate to the amortized cost basis of the security. A credit-related impairment is limited to the difference between fair value and amortized\\ncost, and recognized as an allowance for credit loss on the consolidated balance sheet with a corresponding adjustment to net income (loss). Any remaining decline\\nin fair value that is non-credit related is recognized in other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax. Improvements in expected cash flows due to improvements in\\ncredit are recognized through reversal of the credit loss and corresponding reduction in the allowance for credit loss.\\nEquity Method Investments\\nWe account for investments in the common stock or in-substance common stock of entities that provide us with the ability to exercise significant influence, but\\nnot a controlling financial interest, using the equity method. Investments accounted for under the equity method are initially recorded at cost. Subsequently, we\\nrecognize through the consolidated statements of operations, and as an adjustment to the investment balance, our proportionate share of the investee entities’ net\\nincome or loss, and the amortization of basis differences. In accounting for these investments, we record our share of the entities’ net income or loss one quarter in\\narrears. Equity method investments for which the fair value option is elected are measured at fair value on a recurring basis with changes in fair value reflected in\\nearnings.\\nWe review our equity method investments for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the\\ninvestment may not be fully recoverable. Qualitative and quantitative factors considered as indicators of a potential impairment include financial results and\\noperating trends of the investees, implied values in transactions of the investee’s securities, severity and length of decline in value, and our intention for holding the\\ninvestment, among other factors. If an impairment is determined to be other-than-temporary, the fair value of the impaired investment would have to be determined\\nand an impairment charge recorded for the difference between the fair value and the carrying value of the investment. The fair value determination, particularly for\\ninvestments in privately held companies, requires significant judgment to determine appropriate estimates and assumptions. Changes in these estimates and\\nassumptions could affect the calculation of the fair value of the investments and the determination of the impairment charges.\\nGoodwill Impairment Assessment\\nWe review goodwill for impairment annually (in the fourth quarter) and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that goodwill might be\\nimpaired. We make certain judgments and assumptions to determine our reporting units and in allocating shared assets and liabilities to determine the carrying\\nvalues for each of our reporting units. Determination of reporting units is based on a judgmental evaluation of the level at which our segment managers review\\nfinancial results, evaluate performance, and allocate resources.\\nJudgment in the assessment of qualitative factors of impairment include, among other factors: financial performance; legal, regulatory, contractual, political,\\nbusiness, and other factors; entity specific factors; industry and market considerations, macroeconomic conditions, and other relevant events and factors affecting\\nthe reporting unit. To the extent we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, a quantitative test\\nis then performed.\\nPerforming a quantitative goodwill impairment test includes the determination of the fair value of a reporting unit and involves significant estimates and\\nassumptions. These estimates and assumptions include, among others, revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows,\\nrisk-adjusted discount rates, future economic and market conditions, and the determination of appropriate market comparables.\\nLoss Contingencies\\nWe are involved in legal proceedings, claims, and regulatory, indirect tax examinations, or government inquiries and investigations that may arise in the\\nordinary course of business. Certain of these matters include speculative claims for substantial or indeterminate amounts of damages. We record a liability when we\\nbelieve that it is both probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. If we determine that a loss is reasonably possible and the\\nloss or range of loss can be reasonably estimated, we disclose the possible loss in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements.\\nWe review the developments in our contingencies that could affect the amount of the provisions that have been previously recorded, and the matters and\\nrelated reasonably possible losses disclosed. We make adjustments to our provisions and changes to our disclosures accordingly to reflect the impact of\\nnegotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel, and updated information. Significant judgment is required to determine both the probability and the\\nestimated amount of loss. These estimates have been based\\n65\\non our assessment of the facts and circumstances at each balance sheet date and are subject to change based on new information and future events.\\nThe outcomes of litigation, regulatory, indirect tax examinations and investigations are inherently uncertain. Therefore, if one or more of these matters were\\nresolved against us for amounts in excess of management’s expectations, our results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows, including in a particular\\nreporting period in which any such outcome becomes probable and estimable, could be materially adversely affected.\\nIncome Taxes\\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and foreign jurisdictions. We account for income taxes using the asset and liability method. The\\nestablishment of deferred tax assets from intra-entity transfers of intangible assets requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions to determine\\nthe fair value of such intangible assets. Significant estimates in valuing intangible assets may include, but are not necessarily limited to, internal revenue and\\nexpense forecasts, the estimated life of the intangible assets, comparable transaction values, and/or discount rates. The discount rates used to discount expected\\nfuture cash flows to present value are derived from a weighted-average cost of capital analysis and are adjusted to reflect the inherent risks related to the cash flow.\\nAlthough we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made are reasonable and appropriate, they are based, in part, on historical experience, internal and\\nexternal comparable data and are inherently uncertain. Unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that could affect either the accuracy or validity of such\\nassumptions, estimates or actual results.\\nWe account for uncertainty in tax positions by recognizing a tax benefit from uncertain tax positions when it is more-likely-than-not that the position will be\\nsustained upon examination. Evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes are inherently uncertain and require making\\njudgments, assumptions, and estimates. While we believe we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions, no assurance can be given that the final tax\\noutcome of these matters will not be different. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit. To the extent\\nthat the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences may impact the provision for income taxes and the effective tax\\nrate in the period in which such determination is made.\\nThe provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves as well as the related net interest and penalties. In addition,\\nwe are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the IRS and other tax authorities which may assert assessments against us. We regularly\\nassess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations and assessments to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes.\\nInsurance Reserves\\nWe use a combination of third-party insurance and self-insurance mechanisms, including a wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiary, to provide for the\\npotential liabilities for certain risks, including auto liability, uninsured and underinsured motorist, auto physical damage, general liability, and workers’\\ncompensation. The insurance reserves is an estimate of our potential liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, which represents the estimate of the\\nultimate unpaid obligation for risks retained by us and includes an amount for case reserves related to reported claims and an amount for losses incurred but not\\nreported as of the balance sheet date. The estimate of the ultimate unpaid obligation utilizes generally accepted actuarial methods applied to historical claim and\\nloss experience. In addition, we use assumptions based on actuarial judgment related to claim and loss development patterns and expected loss costs, which\\nconsider frequency trends, severity trends, and relevant industry data. These reserves are continually reviewed and adjusted as experience develops and new\\ninformation becomes known. Adjustments, if any, relating to accidents that occurred in prior years are reflected in the current year results of operations.\\nAll estimates of ultimate losses and allocated loss adjustment expenses, and of resulting reserves, are subject to inherent variability caused by the nature of the\\ninsurance claim settlement process. Such variability is increased for us due to limited historical experience and the nature of the coverage provided. Actual results\\ndepend upon the outcome of future contingent events and can be affected by many factors, such as claim settlement processes and changes in the economic, legal,\\nand social environments. As a result, the net amounts that will ultimately be paid to settle the liability, and when these amounts will be paid, may vary in the near\\nterm from the estimated amounts.\\nWhile management believes that the insurance reserve amount is adequate, the ultimate liability may be in excess of, or less than, the amount provided.\\nStock-Based Compensation\\nWe have granted stock-based awards consisting primarily of stock options, restricted common stock, RSUs, warrants, and SARs to employees, members of our\\nboard of directors and non-employees. The substantial majority of our stock-based awards have been made to employees. The majority of our outstanding RSUs, as\\nwell as certain options, SARs, and shares of restricted common stock, contain a service-based vesting condition. A small portion of the awards contains service-\\nbased vesting condition as well as performance-based vesting condition and/or market-based vesting condition. The service-based vesting condition for the\\nmajority of these awards is satisfied over four years. The performance-based vesting condition is satisfied upon meeting predetermined targets of\\n66\\ncertain financial and operation metrics. The market-based vesting condition is satisfied upon reaching predetermined targets of fully diluted equity values.\\nWe account for stock-based employee compensation under the fair value recognition and measurement provisions, in accordance with applicable accounting\\nstandards, which requires compensation expense for the grant-date fair value of stock-based awards to be recognized over the requisite service period. We account\\nfor forfeitures when they occur.\\nWe have elected to use the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options, warrants, and SARs on the grant date. The Black-\\nScholes option-pricing model requires certain subjective inputs and assumptions, including the fair value of our common stock, the expected term, risk-free interest\\nrates, expected stock price volatility, and expected dividend yield of our common stock.\\nThese assumptions used in the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, other than the fair value of our common stock, are estimated as follows:\\n•\\nExpected term. We estimate the expected term based on the simplified method for employees and on the contractual term for non-employees.\\n•\\nRisk-free interest rate. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.\\n•\\nExpected volatility. We estimate the volatility of our common stock on the date of grant based on the weighted-average historical stock price volatility of\\nour own common shares within the same length of period as the expected term. Where, in some cases, our common share trading history is shorter than\\nthe expected term, we consider comparable publicly-traded companies in our industry group.\\n•\\nExpected dividend yield. Expected dividend yield is zero percent, as we have not paid and do not anticipate paying dividends on our common stock.\\nWe continue to use judgment in evaluating the expected volatility and expected term utilized in our stock-based compensation expense calculation on a\\nprospective basis. As we continue to accumulate additional data related to our common stock, we may refine our estimates of expected volatility and expected term,\\nwhich could materially impact our future stock-based compensation expense.\\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\\nSee Note 1 – Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8,\\n“Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\\nITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\\nWe are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of our business. These risks primarily include interest rate risk, investment risk, and foreign currency\\nrisk as follows:\\nInterest Rate Risk\\nOur exposures to market risk for changes in interest rates relate primarily to our 2025 Refinanced Term Loan and 2027 Refinanced Term Loan Facilities. The\\n2025 and 2027 Refinanced Term Loan Facilities represent floating rate notes and are carried at amortized cost. Therefore, fluctuations in interest rates will impact\\nour consolidated financial statements. A rising interest rate environment will increase the amount of interest paid on these loans. A hypothetical 100 basis point\\nincrease or decrease in interest rates would not have a material effect on our financial results.\\nThe fair value of our fixed rate notes will generally fluctuate with movements of interest rates, increasing in periods of declining rates of interest and declining\\nin periods of increasing rates of interest. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates would have decreased the fair value of our notes by $232 million\\nas of December\\xa031, 2022.\\nInvestment Risk\\nOur investment policy objective aims to preserve capital and meet liquidity requirements without significantly increasing risk. We had cash and cash\\nequivalents including restricted cash and cash equivalents totaling $7.8 billion and $6.7 billion as of December\\xa031, 2021 and December\\xa031, 2022, respectively.\\nMarketable debt securities classified as restricted investments and short-term investments totaled $1.7 billion as of December\\xa031, 2022. As of December\\xa031, 2022,\\nour cash, cash equivalents, and marketable debt securities primarily consist of money market funds, cash deposits, U.S. government securities, U.S. government\\nagency securities, and investment-grade corporate debt securities. We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes. Investments in fixed rate\\nsecurities carry a degree of interest rate risk. Changes in rates would primarily impact interest income due to the relatively short-term nature of our investments. A\\nhypothetical 100 basis point change in interest rates would not have a material effect on our financial results.\\nWe are exposed to certain risk related to the carrying amounts of investments in other companies, including our minority-owned, privately-held affiliates and\\nrecently public companies, compared to their fair value. We hold privately held investments in illiquid private company stock which are inherently difficult to value\\ngiven the lack of publicly available information. We also hold equity securities with readily determinable fair values which are subject to equity price risk. These\\ninvestments in privately-held affiliates and\\n67\\nrecently public companies may increase the volatility in our net income/(loss) in future periods due to changes in the fair value of these investments. In certain\\ncases, our ability to sell these investments may be impacted by contractual obligations to hold the securities for a set period of time after a public offering. As of\\nDecember\\xa031, 2022, the carrying value of our investments was $6.9 billion, including equity method investments and restricted investments.\\nForeign Currency Risk\\nWe transact business globally in multiple currencies. Our international revenue, as well as costs and expenses denominated in foreign currencies, expose us to\\nthe risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar. We are exposed to foreign currency risks related to our revenue and operating\\nexpenses denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Accordingly, changes in exchange rates may negatively affect our future revenue and other operating\\nresults as expressed in U.S. dollars. Our foreign currency risk is partially mitigated as our revenue recognized in currencies other than the U.S. dollar is diversified\\nacross geographic regions and we incur expenses in the same currencies in such regions.\\nWe have experienced and will continue to experience fluctuations in our net income/(loss) as a result of transaction gains or (losses) related to remeasurement\\nof our asset and liability balances that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the entities in which they are recorded. Foreign currency\\nrates may also impact the value of our equity method investment in our Yandex.Taxi joint venture. At this time, we do not, but we may in the future, enter into\\nderivatives or other financial instruments in an attempt to hedge our foreign currency exchange risk.\\n68\\nITEM 8.

We also have audited the Company\\'s internal control over financial reporting as of December\\n31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway\\nCommission (COSO).\\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December\\n31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022 in conformity with\\naccounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal\\ncontrol over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.\\nChange in Accounting Principle\\nAs discussed in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed the manner in which it accounts for convertible instruments and contracts in\\nan entity’s own equity in 2021.\\nBasis for Opinions\\nThe Company\\'s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its\\nassessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\\nappearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company\\'s internal control over\\nfinancial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB)\\nand are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the\\nSecurities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable\\nassurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal\\ncontrol over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial\\nstatements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence\\nregarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant\\nestimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial\\nreporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and\\nevaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we\\nconsidered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the\\npreparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial\\nreporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions\\nand dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial\\nstatements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with\\nauthorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized\\nacquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of\\neffectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with\\nthe policies or procedures may deteriorate.\\n70\\nCritical Audit Matters\\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or\\nrequired to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii)\\ninvolved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the\\nconsolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical\\naudit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\\nPresentation of Mobility and Delivery Revenue Agreements, Including Incentives, Discounts and Promotions to Drivers, Merchants and End-Users\\nAs described in Notes 1 and 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company derives its revenues principally from Drivers’ and Merchants’ use of the\\nCompany’s platform, on-demand lead generation, and related services in connection with Mobility and Delivery services, as well as from direct fees charged to\\nend-users for use of the platform and in exchange for Mobility and Delivery services. Management applies judgment in determining whether the Company is the\\nprincipal or agent in transactions with Drivers, Merchants and end-users. This determination impacts the presentation of revenue on a gross or net basis as well as\\nthe presentation of incentives provided to Drivers and Merchants and discounts and promotions offered to end-users, to the extent they are not customers. For the\\nyear ended December 31, 2022, the Company’s Mobility and Delivery revenue, net of incentives, was $24.9 billion and discounts, loyalty programs, promotions,\\nrefunds, and credits provided to end-users who are not customers totaled $2.2 billion, of which a significant portion relates to discounts and promotions.\\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the presentation of Mobility and Delivery revenue agreements, including\\nincentives, discounts and promotions to Drivers, Merchants, and end-users is a critical audit matter are the significant judgment by management in assessing the\\npresentation of revenue on a gross or net basis, as well as the presentation of incentives, discounts and promotions offered to Drivers, Merchants, and end-users,\\nwhich in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence relating to whether\\ntransaction attributes were appropriately analyzed and presented by management.\\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial\\nstatements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the Company’s revenue recognition process, including controls over the\\npresentation of Mobility and Delivery revenue, incentives, discounts and promotions. These procedures also included, among others, testing, on a sample basis, trip\\ntransaction attributes and assessing management’s classification of new or changed agreements by examining documentation related to the agreement terms, driver\\nstatements, rider receipts, and discount, promotion and incentive terms, and assessing the impact of those terms and attributes on the presentation of revenue and\\nincome statement classification.\\nValuation of Insurance Reserves\\nAs described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, insurance reserves is the liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, which represents\\nthe estimate of the ultimate unpaid obligation for risks retained by the Company and includes an amount for case reserves related to reported claims and an amount\\nfor losses incurred but not reported as of the balance sheet date. The estimate of the ultimate unpaid obligation utilizes generally accepted actuarial methods applied\\nto historical claim and loss experience. In addition, management uses assumptions based on actuarial judgment related to claim and loss development patterns and\\nexpected loss costs, which consider frequency trends, severity trends, and relevant industry data. These reserves are continually reviewed by management and\\nadjusted as experience develops and new information becomes known. The Company’s short-term and long-term insurance reserves as of December 31, 2022\\ntotaled $4.7 billion.\\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the valuation of insurance reserves is a critical audit matter are the\\nsignificant judgment by management when developing the estimate of the insurance reserves, which in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity\\nand effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence relating to the actuarial methods and management’s significant assumptions related to loss\\ndevelopment patterns and expected loss costs. The audit effort also involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.\\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial\\nstatements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the Company’s valuation of insurance reserves, including controls over the\\ndevelopment of the significant assumptions related to loss development patterns and expected loss costs. These procedures also included, among others, the\\ninvolvement of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge to assist in (i) developing, for selected reserve components, an independent actuarial estimate of\\nthe insurance reserves, and comparison of this independent estimate to management’s actuarially determined reserves, and (ii) testing, for other selected reserve\\ncomponents, management’s process for estimating the insurance reserves. Developing the independent estimate involved independently developing the loss\\ndevelopment patterns and expected loss costs and testing the completeness and accuracy of data provided by management. Testing management’s process for\\nestimating the insurance reserves involved evaluating the appropriateness of management’s actuarial methods, evaluating the reasonableness of the significant\\nassumptions used by\\n71\\nmanagement related to loss development patterns and expected loss costs used in those methods, and testing the completeness and accuracy of data used by\\nmanagement.\\n/s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\\nSan Francisco, California\\nFebruary\\xa021, 2023\\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2014.\\n72\\nUBER TECHNOLOGIES,

Policies\\nDescription of Business\\nUber Technologies, Inc. (“Uber,” “we,” “our,” or “us”) was incorporated in Delaware in July 2010, and is headquartered in San Francisco, California. Uber is a\\ntechnology platform that uses a massive network, leading technology, operational excellence and product expertise to power movement from point A to point B.\\nUber develops and operates proprietary technology applications supporting a variety of offerings on its platform (“platform(s)” or “Platform(s)”). Uber connects\\nconsumers (“Rider(s)”) with independent providers of ride services (“Mobility Driver(s)”) for ridesharing services, and connects Riders and other consumers\\n(“Eaters”) with restaurants, grocers and other stores (collectively, “Merchants”) with delivery service providers (“Couriers”) for meal preparation, grocery and\\nother delivery services. Riders and Eaters are collectively referred to as “end-user(s)” or “consumer(s).” Mobility Drivers and Couriers are collectively referred to\\nas “Driver(s).” Uber also connects consumers with public transportation networks. Uber uses this same network, technology, operational excellence and product\\nexpertise to connect shippers with carriers in the freight industry. Uber is also developing technologies designed to provide new solutions to solve everyday\\nproblems.\\nOur technology is used around the world, principally in the United States (“U.S.”) and Canada, Latin America, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and Asia\\n(excluding China and Southeast Asia).\\nBasis of Presentation\\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States\\n(“GAAP”). We consolidate our wholly-owned subsidiaries and majority-owned subsidiaries over which we exercise control, and variable interest entities (“VIE”)\\nwhere we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary. Refer to Note 15 – Variable Interest Entities for further information. All intercompany balances and\\ntransactions have been eliminated.\\nUse of Estimates\\nThe preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions, which affect the\\nreported amounts in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Estimates are based on historical experience, where applicable, and other assumptions which\\nmanagement believes are reasonable under the circumstances. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates estimates, including, but not limited to: fair values of\\ninvestments and other financial instruments (including the measurement of credit or impairment losses); useful lives of amortizable long-lived assets; fair value of\\nacquired intangible assets and related impairment assessments; impairment of\\xa0goodwill; stock-based compensation; income taxes and non-income tax reserves;\\ncertain deferred tax assets and tax liabilities; insurance reserves; and other contingent liabilities. These estimates are inherently subject to judgment and actual\\nresults could differ from those estimates. We considered the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the assumptions and inputs (including market data) supporting\\ncertain of these estimates, assumptions and judgments. The level of uncertainties and volatility related to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic means that these\\nestimates may change in future periods, as new events occur and additional information is obtained.\\nConcentration of Credit Risk\\nCash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, restricted cash and cash equivalents, restricted investments, other receivables, and accounts receivable are\\npotentially subject to credit risk concentration. Cash, cash equivalents, and available-for-sale securities primarily consist of money market funds, cash deposits,\\nU.S. government and agency securities, and investment-grade corporate debt securities. Our investment policy limits the amount of credit exposure with any one\\nfinancial institution or commercial issuer. Cash deposits typically exceed insured limits and are placed with financial institutions around the world that we believe\\nare of high credit quality. We have not experienced any material losses related to these concentrations during the periods presented. Our other receivables primarily\\nconsist of funds withheld by well-established insurance companies with high credit quality that may be used to cover future settlement of reserved insurance\\nclaims. We rely on a limited number of third parties to provide payment processing services (“payment service providers”) to collect amounts due from end-users.\\nPayment service providers are financial institutions or credit card companies that we believe are of high credit quality. No customers accounted for 10% or more of\\nrevenue for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2021 and 2022.\\nCertain Significant Risks and Uncertainties\\nWe have incurred significant net losses since inception and had an accumulated deficit of $32.8 billion as of December 31, 2022. Our operations have\\nhistorically been funded through equity and debt financings. While management currently anticipates that our available cash and cash equivalents, and revolving\\ncredit facility will be sufficient to meet our operational cash needs for at least the next twelve months from the date of issuance of these financial statements,\\nadditional capital may need to be raised or additional indebtedness incurred to continue to fund the operations and other strategic initiatives. We may not be able to\\nobtain additional financing on favorable terms, if at all, or our ability to incur additional indebtedness may be restricted by the terms of our existing debt\\ninstruments.\\n81\\nIn March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of COVID-19 a pandemic. COVID-19 has rapidly impacted market and economic\\nconditions globally. In an attempt to limit the spread of the virus, various governmental restrictions have been implemented, including business activities and travel\\nrestrictions, and “shelter-at-home” orders, that have had an adverse impact on our business and operations by reducing, in particular, the global demand for\\nMobility offerings, while accelerating the growth of our Delivery offerings. In light of the evolving nature of COVID-19 and the uncertainty it continues to produce\\naround the world, it is not possible to predict the COVID-19 pandemic’s cumulative and ultimate impact on our future business operations, results of operations,\\nfinancial position, liquidity, and cash flows. The extent of the impact of the pandemic on our business and financial results will depend largely on future\\ndevelopments, including: the duration of the spread of the outbreak (both globally and within the United States), including whether there will be further resurgences\\nof the outbreak or variants of the virus; the distribution of vaccines in various regions; the impact on capital, foreign currencies exchange and financial markets;\\ngovernmental or regulatory orders that impact our business; and whether the impacts may result in permanent changes to our end-users’ behavior, all of which are\\nhighly uncertain and cannot be predicted.\\nCash and Cash Equivalents\\nCash and cash equivalents consist of cash held in checking and savings accounts as well as investments in money market funds, U.S. government and agency\\nsecurities, commercial paper, corporate bonds, and time deposits. We consider all highly-liquid investments purchased with an original or remaining maturity of\\nthree months or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. Cash includes amounts collected on behalf of, but not yet remitted to Drivers and Merchants,\\nwhich are included in accrued and other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.\\nRestricted Cash and Cash Equivalents\\nRestricted cash and cash equivalents are pledged as security for letters of credit or other collateral amounts established by us for certain insurance policies and\\nalso include cash and cash equivalents that are unavailable for immediate use due to legal and/or contractual restrictions. Restricted cash and cash equivalents are\\nclassified as current and non-current assets based on the contractual or estimated term of the remaining restriction. The reconciliation of cash and cash equivalents\\nand restricted cash and cash equivalents to amounts presented in the consolidated statements of cash flows are as follows (in millions):\\nAs of December 31,\\n2020\\n2021\\n2022\\nCash and cash equivalents\\n$\\n5,647\\xa0\\n$\\n4,295\\xa0\\n$\\n4,208\\xa0\\nRestricted cash and cash equivalents - current\\n250\\xa0\\n631\\xa0\\n680\\xa0\\nRestricted cash and cash equivalents - non-current\\n1,494\\xa0\\n2,879\\xa0\\n1,789\\xa0\\nTotal cash and cash equivalents, and restricted cash and cash equivalents\\n$\\n7,391\\xa0\\n$\\n7,805\\xa0\\n$\\n6,677\\xa0\\nCollateral Held by Insurer\\nCollateral held by insurer represents funds held by James River Group companies (“James River”). These funds, previously held in a trust account, were\\nwithdrawn by James River during the fourth quarter of 2019 upon notice of cancellation of their insurance policies (primarily auto insurance policies) issued to one\\nof our subsidiaries. The funds served as collateral for us and our subsidiary’s current and future claim settlement obligations\\xa0under the indemnification agreements\\nfor these insurance policies as included in insurance reserves on the consolidated balance sheet. Accordingly, the amount withdrawn was presented as collateral\\nheld by insurer on the consolidated balance sheet.\\nDuring the third quarter of 2021, in connection with the legacy auto insurance transfer as described below, James River returned funds, previously presented as\\ncollateral held by insurer, to the trust account where the funds were previously held. Accordingly, the funds were reclassified from collateral held by insurer to non-\\ncurrent restricted cash and cash equivalents on our consolidated balance sheet as of December\\xa031, 2021.\\nLegacy Auto Insurance Transfer\\nOn September 27, 2021, Aleka Insurance, Inc., our wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiary, entered into a Loss Portfolio Transfer Reinsurance Agreement\\n(the “LPTA”) with James River effective July 1, 2021. Pursuant to the LPTA, our captive insurance subsidiary reinsured certain automobile liability insurance risks\\nrelating to activity on our platform between 2013 and 2019 in exchange for payment by James River to our captive insurance subsidiary of a premium in the\\namount of $345 million (“Premium”). Subsequent to the LPTA, we retain substantially all of the liabilities on these policies when taken together with previous risk\\ntransfer arrangements. In connection with the LPTA, claims currently administered by James River will be transferred to a third-party claims administrator for\\nongoing handling (the “Transferred Claims”) at our expense. The liabilities associated with the Transferred Claims were re-evaluated as of September 30, 2021, and\\nadverse development was recognized on certain of those liabilities. During the third quarter of 2021, we recognized a $103 million charge in our consolidated\\nstatement of operations consisting of the difference between the Premium and the assumed liabilities (including the cost of future claims administration), expenses\\nassociated with the LPTA, and the adverse development on the Transferred Claims.\\n82\\nAccounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts\\nAccounts receivable represents uncollected payments from end-users for completed transactions where (i) the payment method is credit card and includes (a)\\nend-user payments not yet settled with payment service providers, and (b) end-user payments settled by payment service providers but not yet remitted to us, (ii)\\ncompleted shipments where we have an unconditional right to the consideration from Freight customers (“Shippers”) and payment has not been received or (iii)\\nuncollected payments from Uber for Business organizations for completed transactions. The timing of settlement of amounts due from these parties varies by\\nregion and by product. The portion of the receivable to be remitted to Drivers and Merchants is included in accrued and other current liabilities. Refer to Note 9 –\\nSupplemental Financial Statement Information for amounts payable to Drivers and Merchants.\\nAlthough we pre-authorize forms of payment to mitigate our exposure, we bear the cost of any accounts receivable losses. We record an allowance for doubtful\\naccounts for accounts receivable that may never settle or be collected, as well as for credit card chargebacks including fraudulent credit card transactions. We\\nconsider the allowance for doubtful accounts for fare amounts to be direct and incremental costs to revenue earned and, therefore, the costs are primarily included\\nas cost of revenue in the consolidated statements of operations. We estimate the allowance based on historical experience,\\xa0 estimated future payments and\\ngeographical trends, which are reviewed periodically and as needed, and amounts are written off when determined to be uncollectible. Chargebacks and credit card\\nlosses were $178 million, $246 million and $286 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2021 and 2022, respectively.\\nProperty and Equipment, Net\\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization is computed using the straight‑line\\nmethod over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which are as follows:\\nProperty and Equipment\\nEstimated Useful Life\\nLand\\nIndefinite\\nBuildings\\n30-45 years\\nSite improvements\\n5-15 years\\nLeased vehicles\\n3-10 years\\nComputer equipment\\n3-5 years\\nFurniture and fixtures\\n3-5 years\\nInternal-use software\\n2 years\\nLeased computer equipment\\nShorter of estimated useful life or lease term\\nLeasehold improvements\\nShorter of estimated useful life or lease term\\nWhen assets are retired or otherwise disposed of, the cost, accumulated depreciation and amortization are removed from the accounts and any resulting gain or\\nloss is reflected in the consolidated statements of operations in the period realized. Maintenance and repairs that do not enhance or extend the asset’s useful life are\\ncharged to operating expenses as incurred.\\nWe capitalize certain costs, such as compensation costs, including stock-based compensation, and interest incurred on outstanding debt, in developing internal-\\nuse software once planning has been completed, management has authorized and committed project funding, and it is probable that the project will be completed\\nand the software will function as intended. Amortization of such costs occurs on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the related asset and begins\\nonce the asset is ready for its intended use. Costs incurred prior to meeting these criteria, together with costs incurred for training and maintenance, are expensed as\\nincurred. In addition, we capitalize interest incurred on outstanding debt during the period of construction-in-progress of certain assets.\\nLeases\\nWe account for leases in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 842, “Leases” (“ASC 842”). We elected the “package of practical\\nexpedients,” which permits us not to reassess under ASC 842 our prior conclusions about lease identification, lease classification and initial direct costs. We made a\\npolicy election not to separate non-lease components from lease components, therefore, we account for lease and non-lease components as a single lease\\ncomponent. We also elected the short-term lease recognition exemption for all leases that qualify.\\nWe determine if a contract contains a lease at inception of the arrangement based on whether we have the right to obtain substantially all of the economic\\nbenefits from the use of an identified asset and whether we have the right to direct the use of an identified asset in exchange for consideration, which relates to an\\nasset which we do not own. Right of use (“ROU”) assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our\\nobligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. ROU assets are recognized as the lease liability, adjusted for lease incentives received. Lease liabilities\\nare recognized at the present value of the future lease payments at the lease commencement date. The interest rate used to determine the present value of the future\\nlease payments is our incremental borrowing rate (“IBR”), because the interest rate implicit in most of our leases is not readily determinable. The IBR is a\\nhypothetical rate based on our understanding of what our credit rating would be to borrow and resulting interest we would pay to borrow an amount equal to the\\nlease payments in a similar economic environment over the lease term on a\\n83\\ncollateralized basis. Lease payments may be fixed or variable; however, only fixed payments or in-substance fixed payments are included in our lease liability\\ncalculation. Variable lease payments may include costs such as common area maintenance, utilities, real estate taxes or other costs. Variable lease payments are\\nrecognized in operating expenses in the period in which the obligation for those payments are incurred.\\nOperating leases are included in operating lease ROU assets, operating lease liabilities, current and operating lease liabilities, non-current on our consolidated\\nbalance sheets. Finance leases are included in property and equipment, net, accrued and other current liabilities, and other long-term liabilities on our consolidated\\nbalance sheets. For operating leases, lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis in operations over the lease term. For finance leases, lease expense is\\nrecognized as depreciation and interest; depreciation on a straight-line basis over the lease term and interest using the effective interest method. As of December 31,\\n2021 and 2022, less than 14% of our operating lease ROU assets related to leased assets outside of the U.S.\\nAcquisitions\\nWe account for acquisitions of entities or asset groups that qualify as businesses in accordance with ASC 805, “Business Combinations” (“ASC 805”). The\\npurchase price of the acquisition is allocated to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the\\nacquisition date. The excess of the purchase price over those fair values is recorded as goodwill. During the measurement period, which may be up to one year from\\nthe acquisition date, we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the\\nmeasurement period or final determination of the values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded\\nin the consolidated statements of operations. Refer to Note 17 – Business Combinations for further information.\\nGoodwill\\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired in a business combination and is allocated to reporting units\\nexpected to benefit from the business combination. We test goodwill for impairment at least annually, in the fourth quarter, or whenever events or changes in\\ncircumstances indicate that goodwill might be impaired. We evaluate our reporting units when changes in our operating structure occur, and if necessary, reassign\\ngoodwill using a relative fair value allocation approach. In testing for goodwill impairment, we first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of\\nevents or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If, after\\nassessing the totality of events or circumstances, we determine it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount,\\nthen additional impairment testing is not required. However, if we conclude otherwise, we proceed to the quantitative assessment.\\nThe quantitative assessment compares the estimated fair value of a reporting unit to its book value, including goodwill. If the fair value exceeds book value,\\ngoodwill is considered not to be impaired and no additional steps are necessary. However, if the book value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment\\nloss will be recognized in an amount equal to that excess, limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. Refer to Note 7 – Goodwill and\\nIntangible Assets for further information.\\nIntangible Assets, Net\\nIntangible assets are carried at cost and amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, which range from two to 18 years. We review\\ndefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment under the long-lived asset model described in the Evaluation of Long-Lived Assets for Impairment section. Refer to\\nNote 7 – Goodwill and Intangible Assets for further information.\\nInvestments\\nEquity Securities\\nAccounting for our equity securities varies depending on the marketability of the security and the type of investment. Our marketable equity securities in\\npublicly traded companies are measured at fair value with unrealized gains and losses recognized in the consolidated statements of operations. Certain investments\\nin non-marketable equity securities are measured at cost, with remeasurements to fair value only upon the occurrence of observable price changes in orderly\\ntransactions for the identical or similar securities of the same issuer, or in the event of any impairment. We reassess at each reporting period to determine whether\\nnon-marketable equity securities have a readily determinable fair value, in which case they would no longer be eligible for fair value measurement alternative.\\nNon-marketable equity securities that we elected to apply the fair value option and equity securities with a readily determinable fair value are measured at fair\\nvalue on a recurring basis with changes in fair value recognized in the consolidated statements of operations. We evaluate our non-marketable equity securities for\\nimpairment at each reporting period based on a qualitative assessment that considers various potential impairment indicators. Impairment indicators might include,\\nbut would not necessarily be limited to, a significant deterioration in the earnings performance, credit rating, asset quality, or business prospects of the investee, a\\nsignificant adverse change in the regulatory, economic, or technological environment of the investee, a bona fide offer to purchase, an offer by the investee to sell,\\nor a completed auction process for the same or similar securities for an amount less than the carrying amount of the investments in those securities. If an\\nimpairment exists, a loss is recognized in the consolidated statements of operations for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the\\ninvestment. We include investments in equity\\n84\\nsecurities within investments on the consolidated balance sheets.\\nDebt Securities\\nAccounting for our debt securities varies depending on the legal form of the security, our intended holding period for the security, and the nature of the\\ntransaction. Investments in debt securities are classified as available-for-sale and are initially recorded at fair value. Investments in marketable debt securities may\\ninclude U.S. government and agency securities, commercial paper, corporate bonds, and time deposits. Certain investments in non-marketable equity securities\\nwith redemption, interest, or other debt-like features were classified as available-for-sale debt securities. Subsequent changes in fair value of available-for-sale debt\\nsecurities are recorded in other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax. We record certain of our debt securities at fair value with the changes in fair value recorded\\nin earnings under the fair value option of accounting for financial instruments.\\nAs of December\\xa031, 2022, we considered our marketable debt securities as available for use in current operations, including those with maturity dates beyond\\none year, and therefore classify these securities as short-term investments on the consolidated balance sheet.\\nAllowance for Credit Losses on Available-for-sale Debt Securities\\nWe account for credit losses on available-for-sale debt securities in accordance with ASC 326, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (“ASC 326”). Under ASC\\n326, at each reporting period, we evaluate our available-for-sale debt securities at the individual security level to determine whether there is a decline in the fair\\nvalue below its amortized cost basis (an impairment). In circumstances where we intend to sell, or are more likely than not required to sell, the security before it\\nrecovers its amortized cost basis, the difference between fair value and amortized cost is recognized as a loss in the consolidated statements of operations, with a\\ncorresponding write-down of the security’s amortized cost. In circumstances where neither condition exists, we then evaluate whether a decline is due to credit-\\nrelated factors. The factors considered in determining whether a credit loss exists can include the extent to which fair value is less than the amortized cost basis,\\nchanges in the credit quality of the underlying loan obligors, credit ratings actions, as well as other factors. To determine the portion of a decline in fair value that is\\ncredit-related, we compare the present value of the expected cash flows of the security discounted at the security’s effective interest rate to the amortized cost basis\\nof the security. A credit-related impairment is limited to the difference between fair value and amortized cost, and recognized as an allowance for credit loss on the\\nconsolidated balance sheet with a corresponding adjustment to net income (loss). Any remaining decline in fair value that is non-credit related is recognized in\\nother comprehensive income (loss), net of tax. Improvements in expected cash flows due to improvements in credit are recognized through reversal of the credit\\nloss and corresponding reduction in the allowance for credit loss.\\nRestricted Investments\\nAs of December\\xa031, 2022, restricted investments on the consolidated balance sheet are comprised of marketable debt securities that may include U.S.\\ngovernment and agency securities, commercial paper, corporate bonds, and time deposits, which are held in trust accounts at third-party financial institutions\\npursuant to certain contracts with insurance providers. Restricted investments are classified as non-current assets as these investments are unavailable for use in\\nshort-term operations due to legal and/or contractual restrictions.\\nEquity Method Investments\\nInvestments in common stock or in-substance common stock of entities that provide us with the ability to exercise significant influence, but not a controlling\\nfinancial interest, over the investee are accounted for under the equity method of accounting, unless the fair value option is elected. Investments accounted for\\nunder the equity method are initially recorded at cost. Subsequently, we recognize through the consolidated statements of operations and as an adjustment to the\\ninvestment balance, our proportionate share of the investees’ net income or loss and the amortization of basis differences. We record our share of the results of\\nequity method investments one quarter in arrears as income (loss) from equity method investment, net of tax in the consolidated statements of operations. We\\nevaluate each of our equity method investments at the end of each reporting period to determine whether events or changes in business circumstances indicate that\\nthe carrying value of the investment may not be fully recoverable. We recognize in the consolidated statements of operations and as an adjustment to the investment\\nbalance, any required impairment loss. Evidence of a loss in value might include, but would not necessarily be limited to, absence of an ability to recover the\\ncarrying amount of the investment or inability of the investee to sustain an earnings capacity that would justify the carrying amount of the investment. This\\nevaluation consists of several qualitative and quantitative factors including recent financial results and operating trends of the investee; implied values in recent\\ntransactions of investee securities; other publicly available information that may affect the value of our investments.\\nEvaluation of Long-Lived Assets for Impairment\\nWe evaluate our held-and-used long-lived assets for indicators of possible impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount\\nof an asset or asset group (collectively, the “asset group”) may not be recoverable. We measure the recoverability of the asset group by comparing the carrying\\namount of such asset groups to the future undiscounted cash flows it expects the asset group to generate. If we consider the asset group to be impaired, the\\nimpairment to be recognized equals the amount by which the carrying value of the asset group exceeds its fair value.\\n85\\nFair Value Measurements and Financial Instruments\\nFair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the\\nmeasurement date. In accordance with ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement (“ASC 820”), we use the fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used to\\nmeasure fair value. The hierarchy, as defined below, gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the\\nlowest priority to unobservable inputs. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are set forth below:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nLevel\\xa01\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\\nLevel\\xa02\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices in markets that are\\nnot active or inputs other than the quoted prices that are observable either directly or indirectly for the full term of the assets or liabilities.\\nLevel\\xa03\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.\\nOur primary financial instruments include receivables, investments in debt and equity securities, accounts payable, accrued liabilities, long-term debt and\\nwarrants. The estimated fair value of marketable debt securities, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximates their carrying value due\\nto the short-term maturities of these instruments. Refer to Note 3 – Investments and Fair Value Measurement and Note 8 – Long-Term Debt and Revolving Credit\\nArrangements for further information.\\nVariable Interest Entities\\nWe evaluate our ownership, contractual and other interests in entities to determine if we have a variable interest in an entity. These evaluations are complex,\\ninvolve judgment, and the use of estimates and assumptions based on available historical and prospective information, among other factors. If we determine that an\\nentity for which we hold a contractual or ownership interest in is a VIE and that we are the primary beneficiary, we consolidate such entity in the consolidated\\nfinancial statements. The primary beneficiary of a VIE is the party that meets both of the following criteria: (1) has the power to make decisions that most\\nsignificantly affect the economic performance of the VIE; and (2) has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that in either case could\\npotentially be significant to the VIE. Periodically, we determine whether any changes in the interest or relationship with the entity impacts the determination of\\nwhether we are still the primary beneficiary. If we are not deemed to be the primary beneficiary in a VIE, we account for the investment or other variable interests\\nin a VIE in accordance with applicable GAAP. Refer to Note 15 – Variable Interest Entities for further information.\\nRevenue Recognition\\nWe recognize revenue when or as we satisfy our obligations. We derive our revenues principally from Drivers’ and Merchants’ use of our platform, on-demand\\nlead generation, and related services, including facilitating payments from end-users. The service enables Drivers and Merchants to seek, receive and fulfill on-\\ndemand requests from end-users seeking Mobility or Delivery services (collectively the “Uber Service”). Beginning in 2020, in certain markets we also generate\\nrevenue from end-users. We charge a direct fee for use of the platform and in exchange for Mobility and Delivery services. Additionally, we derive revenue from\\ncustomers\\' use of Freight services.\\nWe periodically reassess our revenue recognition policies as new offerings become material, and business models and other factors evolve.\\nMobility and Delivery Agreements\\nWe primarily enter into Master Services Agreements (“MSA”) with Drivers and Merchants to use the platform. The MSA defines the service fee we charge\\nDrivers and Merchants for each transaction. Upon acceptance of a transaction, Drivers and Merchants agree to perform the services as requested by an end-user.\\nThe acceptance of a transaction request combined with the MSA establishes enforceable rights and obligations for each transaction. A contract exists between us\\nand the Drivers and Merchants after the Drivers and Merchants accept a transaction request and the Drivers’ and Merchants’ ability to cancel the transaction lapses.\\nThe Uber Service activities are performed to satisfy our sole performance obligation in the transaction, which is to connect Drivers and Merchants with end-\\nusers to facilitate the completion of a successful transaction.\\nIn 2020, we modified our arrangements in certain markets and, as a result, concluded we are responsible for Delivery services to end-users in those markets.\\nWe have determined that in these transactions, Merchants and end-users are our customers and revenue from these contracts shall be recognized separately for each\\nunder ASC 606. We recognize Delivery service revenue associated with our performance obligation over the contract term, which represents its performance over\\nthe period of time the delivery is occurring. We recognized revenue from end-users of $91 million, $710 million, and $1.3 billion for the years ended December 31,\\n2020, 2021 and 2022, respectively, associated with these Delivery transactions. We recognized cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization of $439\\nmillion, $2.4 billion, and $3.8 billion for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2021 and 2022, respectively, associated with these Delivery transactions.\\n86\\nIn 2020, we began charging Mobility end-users a fee to use the platform in certain markets. In these transactions, in addition to a performance obligation to\\nDrivers, we also have a performance obligation to end-users, which is to connect end-users to Drivers in the marketplace. We recognize revenue when a trip is\\ncomplete. We present revenue on a net basis for these transactions, as we do not control the service provided by Drivers to end-users.\\nIn 2022, we modified our arrangements in certain markets and, as a result, concluded we are responsible for the provision of Mobility services to end-users in\\nthose markets. We have determined that in these transactions, end-users are our customers and our sole performance obligation in the transaction is to provide\\ntransportation services to the end-user. We recognize revenue when a trip is complete. In these markets where we are responsible for Mobility services, we present\\nrevenue from end-users on a gross basis, as we control the service provided by Drivers to end-users, while payments to Drivers in exchange for Mobility services\\nare recognized in cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization.\\nIn all markets aside from the above three scenarios, end-users are not our customers as end-users access the platform for free and we have no performance\\nobligation to end-users.\\nPrincipal vs. Agent Considerations\\nJudgment is required in determining whether we are the principal or agent in transactions with Drivers, Merchants and end-users. We evaluate the presentation\\nof revenue on a gross or net basis based on whether we control the service provided to the end-user and are the principal (i.e. “gross”), or we arrange for other\\nparties to provide the service to the end-user and are an agent (i.e. “net”). This determination also impacts the presentation of incentives provided to Drivers and\\nMerchants and discounts and promotions offered to end-users to the extent they are not customers.\\nFor the majority of Mobility and Delivery transactions, our role is to provide the Uber Service to Drivers and Merchants to facilitate a successful trip or\\nDelivery service to end-users. We concluded we do not control the good or service provided by Drivers and Merchants to end-users as (i) we do not pre-purchase or\\notherwise obtain control of the Drivers’ and Merchants’ goods or services prior to its transfer to the end-user; (ii) we do not direct Drivers and Merchants to\\nperform the service on our behalf, and (iii) we do not integrate services provided by Drivers and Merchants with our other services and then provide them to end-\\nusers. As part of our evaluation of control, we review other specific indicators to assist in the principal versus agent conclusions. We are not primarily responsible\\nfor Mobility and Delivery services provided to end-users, nor do we have inventory risk related to these services. While we facilitate setting the price for Mobility\\nand Delivery services, the Drivers and Merchants and end-users have the ultimate discretion in accepting the transaction price and this indicator alone does not\\nresult in us controlling the services provided to end-users.\\nIn the vast majority of transactions with end-users, we act as an agent of the Driver or Merchant by connecting end-users seeking Mobility and Delivery\\nservices with Drivers and Merchants looking to provide these services. Drivers and Merchants are our customers and pay us a service fee for each successfully\\ncompleted transaction with end-users. Accordingly, we recognize revenue on a net basis, representing the fee we expect to receive in exchange for us providing the\\nservice to Drivers and Merchants. In certain markets, we promise Mobility or Delivery services to end-users for a fee and separately subcontract with Drivers to\\nprovide the Mobility or Delivery services. In these markets, we are the principal for the services and present the respective Mobility and Delivery revenue on a\\ngross basis because we are primarily responsible for the services.\\nMobility\\nWe derive our Mobility revenue primarily from service fees paid by Drivers for use of the platform and related service to connect with Riders and successfully\\ncomplete a trip via the Platform. We recognize revenue when a trip is complete.\\nDepending on the market where the trip is completed, the service fee is either a fixed percentage of the end-user fare or the difference between the amount paid\\nby an end-user and the amount earned by Drivers. In markets where we earn the difference between the amount paid by an end-user and the amount earned by\\nDrivers, end-users are quoted a fixed upfront price for ridesharing services while we pay Drivers based on actual time and distance for the ridesharing services\\nprovided. Therefore, we can earn a variable amount and may realize a loss on the transaction. We typically receive the service fee within a short period of time\\nfollowing the completion of a trip.\\nIn addition, end-users in certain markets have the option to pay cash for trips. On such trips, cash is paid by end-users to Drivers. We generally collect our\\nservice fee from Drivers for these trips by offsetting against any other amounts due to Drivers, including Drivers incentives, or via online payment methods. As we\\ncurrently have limited means to collect our service fee for cash trips and cannot control whether Drivers will generate future amounts owed to them for offset, we\\nconcluded collectability of such amounts is not probable until collected. As such, uncollected service fees for cash trips are not recognized in the consolidated\\nfinancial statements until collected from Drivers.\\nMobility revenue also includes immaterial revenue streams such as our financial partnerships products.\\n87\\nDelivery\\nWe derive our Delivery revenue primarily from service fees paid by Couriers and Merchants for use of the platform and related service to successfully\\ncomplete a meal delivery service on the platform. In certain markets, Delivery also includes offerings for grocery, alcohol and convenience store delivery as well as\\nselect other goods. We recognize revenue when a Delivery transaction is complete.\\nIn the majority of transactions, the service fee paid by Merchants is a fixed percentage of the meal price. The service fee paid by Couriers is the difference\\nbetween the delivery fee amount paid by the end-user and the amount earned by the Couriers. End-users are quoted a fixed price for the meal delivery while we pay\\nCouriers based on time and distance for the delivery. Therefore, we earn a variable amount on a transaction and may realize a loss on the transaction. We typically\\nreceive the service fee within a short period of time following the completion of a delivery.\\nFreight\\nWe derive our Freight revenue from freight transportation services provided to Shippers.\\nBrokerage\\nBrokerage revenue represents the gross amount of fees charged to Shippers for our services because we control the service provided to customers. Costs\\nincurred with carriers for Brokerage are recorded in cost of revenue. Shippers contract with us to utilize our network of independent freight carriers to transport\\nfreight. We enter into contracts with Shippers that define the price for each shipment and payment terms. Our acceptance of the shipment request establishes\\nenforceable rights and obligations for each contract. By accepting the Shipper\\'s order, we have responsibility for transportation of the shipment from origin to\\ndestination. We enter into separate contracts with independent freight carriers and are responsible for prompt payment of freight charges to the carrier regardless of\\npayment by the Shipper. We invoice the Shipper upon satisfaction of our sole performance obligation to transport a Shipper’s freight using our network of\\nindependent freight carriers. We recognize revenue associated with our performance obligation over the contract term, which represents our performance over the\\nperiod of time a shipment is in transit. While the transit period of our contracts can vary based on origin and destination, contracts still in transit at period end are\\nnot material. Payment for our services is generally due within 30 to 45 days upon receipt of invoice.\\nTransportation Management\\nWe provide an integrated logistics and transportation service, which can include shipment planning, freight optimization, carrier assignment, load management,\\nfreight audit and payment processing and other related transportation services. Our sole performance obligation in these contracts is the integration of these services\\nto transport the Shipper’s freight on a shipment-by-shipment basis. The majority of our transportation management revenue is recognized on a gross basis in the\\namount of gross fees charged to Shippers upon satisfaction of our performance obligation because we control the service provided to customers. Costs incurred\\nwith carriers for these transactions are recorded in cost of revenue. In transactions where we do not control the service provided to customers, we recognize revenue\\non a net basis. Revenue is recognized as our performance obligation is satisfied, which generally represents the transit period from origin to destination by a third-\\nparty carrier. While the transit period of our contracts can vary based on origin and destination, contracts still in transit at period end are not material. Payment for\\nour services is generally due within 30 to 60 days upon completion of our performance obligation.\\nPrincipal vs. Agent Considerations\\nJudgment is required in determining whether we are the principal or agent in transactions with Shippers. For contracts where we control the service before it is\\ntransferred to the Shipper, we are primarily responsible for identifying and directing independent freight carriers to transport the Shipper’s goods, including having\\ndiscretion in selecting a qualified independent freight carrier that meets the Shipper’s specifications. We also have pricing discretion for the price(s) charged to\\nShippers and amounts paid to Carriers. Accordingly, we are the principal in these transactions. In certain arrangements, we do not control the service provided to\\ncustomers as we do not have latitude in carrier selection and establishing rates with the Carrier. Revenue is recognized on a net basis for these transactions.\\nContracts where we do not control the service before it is transferred to the Shipper are not material for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2021 and 2022.\\nAll Other Revenue\\nAll other revenue includes revenue from immaterial sources such as New Mobility products and Advanced Technologies Group’s (“ATG”) collaboration\\nrevenue.\\nAdvertising Revenue\\nWe derive the majority of our advertising revenue from sponsored listing fees paid by merchants and brands in exchange for advertising on our platform.\\nAdvertising revenue is recognized when an end-user engages with the sponsored listing based on the number of clicks. Revenue is presented on a gross basis in the\\namount billed to merchants and brands as we control the advertisement before it is transferred to the end-user.\\n88\\nIncentives to Customers\\nIncentives provided to customers are recorded as a reduction of revenue if we do not receive a distinct good or service or cannot reasonably estimate the fair\\nvalue of the good or service received. Incentives to customers that are not provided in exchange for a distinct good or service are evaluated as variable\\nconsideration, in the most likely amount to be earned by the customer at the time or as they are earned by customers, depending on the type of incentive. Since\\nincentives are earned over a short period of time, there is limited uncertainty when estimating variable consideration.\\nIncentives earned by customers for referring new customers are paid in exchange for a distinct service and are accounted for as customer acquisition costs. We\\nexpense such referral payments as incurred in sales and marketing expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. We apply the practical expedient under\\nASC 340-40-25-4 and expense costs to acquire new customer contracts as incurred because the amortization period would be one year or less. The amount\\nrecorded as an expense is the lesser of the amount of the incentive paid or the established fair value of the service received. Fair value of the service is established\\nusing amounts paid to vendors for similar services. The amounts paid to customers presented as sales and marketing expenses for the years ended December 31,\\n2020, 2021 and 2022 were immaterial.\\nIn some transactions, incentives and payments made to customers may exceed the revenue earned in the transaction. In these transactions, the resulting\\nshortfall amount is recorded as a reduction of revenue.\\nEnd-User Discounts and Promotions\\nWe offer discounts and promotions to end-users (that are not our customers) to encourage use of our platform. These are offered in various forms of discounts\\nand promotions and include:\\nTargeted end-user discounts and promotions: These discounts and promotions are offered to a limited number of end-users in a market to acquire, re-engage,\\nor generally increase end-users use of the Platform, and are akin to a coupon. An example is an offer providing a discount on a limited number of rides or meal\\ndeliveries during a limited time period. We record the cost of these discounts and promotions to end-users who are not our customers as sales and marketing\\nexpenses at the time they are redeemed by the end-user.\\nEnd-user referrals: These referrals are earned when an existing end-user (the referring end-user) refers a new end-user (the referred end-user) to the platform\\nand the new end-user who is not our customer takes their first ride on the platform. These referrals are typically paid in the form of a credit given to the referring\\nend-user. These referrals are offered to attract new end-users to the Platform. We record the liability for these referrals and corresponding expenses as sales and\\nmarketing expenses at the time the referral is earned by the referring end-user.\\nMarket-wide promotions: These promotions are pricing actions in the form of discounts that reduce the end-user fare charged by Drivers and Merchants to\\nend-users who are not our customers for all or substantially all Mobility or meal deliveries in a specific market. This also includes any discounts offered under our\\nsubscription offerings and certain discounts within the Uber Rewards programs, which enable End-users to receive a fixed fare or a discount on all eligible rides.\\nAccordingly, we record the cost of these promotions as a reduction of revenue at the time the transaction is completed.\\nRefunds and Credits\\nRefunds and credits to end-users due to end-user dissatisfaction with the Platform are recorded as marketing expenses or as a reduction of revenue depending\\non whether the end-user is considered a customer based on the market. Refunds to end-users that we recover from Drivers and Merchants are recorded as a\\nreduction of revenue.\\nOther\\nWe have elected to exclude from revenue, taxes assessed by a governmental authority that are both imposed on and are concurrent with specific revenue\\nproducing transactions, and collected from Drivers, Merchants and end-users and remitted to governmental authorities. Accordingly, such amounts are not included\\nas a component of revenue or cost of revenue.\\nPractical Expedients\\nWe have utilized the practical expedient available under ASC 606-10-50-14 and do not disclose the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for contracts\\nwith an original expected length of one year or less. We have no significant financing components in our contracts with customers.\\nStock-Based Compensation\\nWe account for stock-based compensation expense in accordance with the fair value recognition and measurement provisions of GAAP, which requires\\ncompensation cost for the grant-date fair value of stock-based awards to be recognized over the requisite service period. We account for\\xa0forfeitures\\xa0when they\\noccur. The fair value of stock-based awards, granted or modified, is determined on the grant date (or modification or acquisition dates, if applicable) at fair value,\\nusing appropriate valuation techniques.\\nService-Based Awards\\n89\\nWe record stock-based compensation expense for service-based stock options and restricted stock units (“RSU(s)”) on a straight-line basis over the requisite\\nservice period, which is generally four years.\\nFor stock options with service-based vesting conditions only and stock purchase rights provided under our employee stock purchase plan, the valuation model,\\ntypically the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, incorporates various assumptions including expected stock price volatility, expected term and risk-free interest\\nrates. We estimate the volatility of common stock on the date of grant based on the weighted-average historical stock price volatility of our own shares or\\ncomparable publicly traded companies in our industry group. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant with a\\nterm equal to the expected term. We estimate the expected term based on the simplified method for employee stock options considered to be “plain vanilla” options,\\nas our historical share option exercise experience does not provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate the expected term. We estimate the expected term for\\nnon-employees’ options based on the contractual term. U.S. The expected dividend yield is 0.0% as we have not paid and do not anticipate paying dividends on our\\ncommon stock.\\nPerformance-Based Awards\\nWe have granted restricted common stock awards (“RSA(s)”), RSUs, stock appreciation rights (“SAR(s)”), stock options, and warrants that vest upon the\\nsatisfaction of both service-based and performance-based conditions. The service-based condition for these awards generally is satisfied over three or four years.\\nThe performance-based conditions generally are satisfied upon achieving specified performance targets, such as our financial or operating metrics, and/or the\\noccurrence of a qualifying event, defined as the earlier of (i) the closing of certain specific liquidation or change in control transactions, or (ii) an initial public\\noffering (“IPO”). We record stock-based compensation expense for performance-based equity awards such as RSAs, RSUs, SARs, and stock options on an\\naccelerated attribution method over the requisite service period, which is generally three or four years, and only if performance-based conditions are considered\\nprobable to be satisfied.\\nFor performance-based awards and RSUs, we determine the grant-date fair value to be the fair value of our common stock on the grant date.\\nFor performance-based SARs, stock options, and warrants, we determine the grant-date fair value utilizing the valuation model as described above for service-\\nbased awards.\\nMarket-Based Awards\\nWe have granted RSUs and stock options that vest only upon the satisfaction of all the following conditions: service-based conditions, performance-based\\nconditions, and/or market-based conditions. The service-based condition for these awards generally is satisfied over three or four years. The performance-based\\nconditions generally are satisfied upon achieving specified performance targets, such as the occurrence of a qualifying event, as described above for performance-\\nbased awards. The market-based conditions are satisfied upon our achievement of specified fully-diluted equity values, as determined based on our stock price.\\nFor market-based awards, we determine the grant-date fair value utilizing a Monte Carlo valuation model, which incorporates various assumptions including\\nexpected stock price volatility, expected term, risk-free interest rates, expected date of a qualifying event, and expected capital raise percentage. We estimate the\\nvolatility of common stock on the date of grant based on the weighted-average historical stock price volatility of comparable publicly-traded companies in its\\nindustry group. We estimate the expected term based on various exercise scenarios. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at\\nthe time of grant. Prior to our IPO in May 2019, we estimated the expected date of a qualifying event based on third-party valuations of our common stock and\\nestimated the expected capital raise percentage based on management\\'s expectations at the time of measurement of the award\\'s value.\\nWe record stock-based compensation expense for market-based equity awards such as RSUs and stock options on an accelerated attribution method over the\\nrequisite service period, and only if performance-based conditions are considered probable to be satisfied. We determine the requisite service period by comparing\\nthe derived service period to achieve the market-based condition and the explicit service-based period, using the longer of the two service periods as the requisite\\nservice period.\\nEmployee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”)\\nWe recognize stock-based expenses related to shares issued pursuant to our 2019 ESPP on a straight-line basis over the offering period. The\\xa0ESPP\\xa0provides for\\ntwelve-month offering periods, and each offering period includes two purchase periods of approximately six months. The ESPP\\xa0allows eligible employees to\\npurchase shares of our common stock at a\\xa015 percent\\xa0discount on the lower price of either (i) the offering period begin date or (ii) the purchase date. We estimate\\nthe fair value of shares to be issued under the\\xa0ESPP based on a combination of options valued using the\\xa0Black-Scholes\\xa0option-pricing model. We determine\\nvolatility over an expected term of six months and twelve months based on our historical volatility. We estimate the expected term based on the contractual term.\\nCommon Stock Fair Value\\nSubsequent to our IPO in May 2019, the fair value of common stock was determined on the grant date using the closing price of our\\xa0common\\xa0stock.\\n90\\nPrior to our IPO, the absence of an active market for our common stock required the Board of Directors, the members of which we believe have extensive\\nbusiness, finance and venture capital experience, to determine the fair value of our common stock for purposes of granting stock-based awards and for calculating\\nstock-based compensation expense. We obtained contemporaneous third-party valuations to assist the Board of Directors in determining fair value. These\\ncontemporaneous third-party valuations used the methodologies, approaches and assumptions consistent with the American Institute of Certified Public\\nAccountants Practice Guide, Valuation of Privately-Held-Company Equity Securities Issued as Compensation.\\nIncome Taxes\\nWe account for income taxes using the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future\\ntax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements.\\nWe account for uncertainty in tax positions recognized in the consolidated financial statements by recognizing a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position\\nwhen it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on\\nthe technical merits. Income tax positions must meet a more-likely-than-not recognition threshold at the effective date to be recognized.\\nWe recognize accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the provision for (benefit from) income taxes in the consolidated statements\\nof operations.\\nValuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts that are more-likely-than-not expected to be realized based\\non the weighting of positive and negative evidence. Future realization of deferred tax assets ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income of the\\nappropriate character (for example, ordinary income or capital gain) within the carryback or carryforward periods available under the applicable tax law. We\\nregularly review the deferred tax assets for recoverability based on historical taxable income, projected future taxable income, the expected timing of the reversals\\nof existing temporary differences and tax planning strategies. Our judgment regarding future profitability may change due to many factors, including future market\\nconditions and the ability to successfully execute the business plans and/or tax planning strategies. Should there be a change in the ability to recover deferred tax\\nassets, our income tax provision would increase or decrease in the period in which the assessment is changed. We elected the tax law ordering approach in\\nassessing the realizability of net operating losses expected to offset future Global Intangible Low-taxed Income (“GILTI”).\\nWe have elected to treat any potential GILTI inclusions as a period cost.\\nThe establishment of deferred tax assets from intra-entity transfers of intangible assets requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions to\\ndetermine the fair value of such intangible assets. Significant estimates in valuing intangible assets may include, but are not necessarily limited to, internal revenue\\nand expense forecasts, the estimated life of the intangible assets, comparable transaction values, and/or discount rates. The discount rates used to discount expected\\nfuture cash flows to present value are derived from a weighted-average cost of capital analysis and are adjusted to reflect the inherent risks related to the cash flow.\\nAlthough we believe the assumptions and estimates utilized are reasonable and appropriate, they are based, in part, on historical experience, internal and external\\ncomparable data and are inherently uncertain. Unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that could affect either the accuracy or validity of such\\nassumptions, estimates or actual results.\\nExpenses\\nSet forth below is a brief description of the components of our expenses:\\n•\\nCost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, primarily consists of certain insurance costs related to our Mobility and Delivery offerings,\\ncredit card processing fees, bank fees, data center and networking expenses, mobile device and service costs, costs incurred with Carriers for Uber Freight\\ntransportation services, amounts related to fare chargebacks and other credit card losses as well as costs incurred for certain Mobility and Delivery\\ntransactions where we are primarily responsible for mobility or delivery services and pay Drivers and Couriers for services.\\n•\\nOperations and support expenses primarily consist of compensation costs, including stock-based compensation, for employees that support operations in\\ncities, including the general managers, Driver operations, platform user support representatives and community managers. Also included is the cost of\\ncustomer support, Driver background checks and the allocation of certain corporate costs.\\n•\\nSales and marketing expenses primarily consist of compensation costs, including stock-based compensation to sales and marketing employees, advertising\\ncosts, product marketing costs and discounts, loyalty programs, promotions, refunds, and credits provided to end-users who are not customers, and the\\nallocation of certain corporate costs. We expense advertising and other promotional expenditures as incurred. Advertising expenses totaled $1.0 billion,\\n$1.7 billion and $1.7 billion for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2021 and 2022, respectively. Discounts, loyalty programs, promotions, refunds, and\\ncredits provided to end-users who are not customers totaled $2.0 billion, $2.4 billion, and $2.2 billion for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2021 and\\n2022, respectively.\\n91\\n•\\nResearch and development expenses primarily consist of compensation costs, including stock-based compensation, for employees in engineering, design\\nand product development. Expenses includes ATG and Other Technology Programs development expenses prior to the divestiture of our ATG business in\\nJanuary 2021, as well as expenses associated with ongoing improvements to, and maintenance of, existing products and services, and allocation of certain\\ncorporate costs.\\n•\\nGeneral and administrative expenses primarily consist of compensation costs, including stock-based compensation, for executive management and\\nadministrative employees, including finance and accounting, human resources, policy and communications, legal, and certain impairment charges, as well\\nas allocation of certain corporate costs, occupancy, and general corporate insurance costs. General and administrative expenses also include certain legal\\nsettlements.\\n•\\nDepreciation and amortization expenses primarily consist of depreciation on buildings, site improvements, computer and network equipment, software,\\nleasehold improvements, furniture and fixtures, and amortization of intangible assets.\\nRestructuring and Related Charges\\nCosts associated with management-approved restructuring activities, including reductions in headcount, exiting a market or consolidation of facilities are\\nrecognized when they are incurred and may include employee termination benefits, impairment of long-lived assets (including impairment of operating lease right-\\nof-use assets), contract termination costs and accelerated lease cost for right-of-use assets that ceased to be used. We record a liability for employee termination\\nbenefits either when it is probable that an employee is entitled to them and the amount of the benefits can be reasonably estimated or when management has\\ncommunicated the termination plan to employees and all of the following conditions have been met: management, having the authority to approve the action,\\ncommits to a plan of termination; the plan identifies the number of employees to be terminated, their job classifications and their locations, and the expected\\ncompletion date; the plan establishes the terms of the benefit arrangement in sufficient detail to enable employees to determine the type and amount of benefits they\\nwill receive if they are involuntarily terminated; and actions required to complete the plan indicate that it is unlikely that significant changes to the plan will be\\nmade or that the plan will be withdrawn. We accrue for costs to terminate contracts other than a lease when we terminate the contract in accordance with the\\ncontract terms. Costs that will continue to be incurred for the remaining term of a contract that is not a lease, and provide no economic benefits to us are recognized\\nat the cease-use date. Costs associated with lease contracts are accounted for under the leasing accounting guidance or under the long-lived assets accounting\\nguidance.\\nRestructuring and related charges are recognized as an operating expense within the consolidated statements of operations and are classified based on our\\nclassification policy for each category of operating expense. Personnel costs are classified based on each employee’s classification, lease costs (including\\nimpairments of right-of-use assets) are classified in the same expense line item where each lease’s rent expense was recognized and impairment of other long-lived\\nassets are recorded within general and administrative expenses.\\nForeign Currency\\nThe functional currency of our foreign subsidiaries is the local currency or U.S. dollar depending on the nature of the subsidiaries’ activities. Monetary assets\\nand liabilities, and transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are remeasured to the functional currency at the exchange rate in effect\\nat the end of the period and are recorded in the current period consolidated statement of operations. Gains and losses resulting from remeasurement are recorded in\\nforeign exchange gains (losses), net within other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations. Subsidiary assets and liabilities with non-U.S.\\ndollar functional currencies are translated at the month-end rate, retained earnings and other equity items are translated at historical rates, and revenues and\\nexpenses are translated at average exchange rates during the year. Cumulative translation adjustments are recorded within accumulated other comprehensive\\nincome (loss), a separate component of total equity (deficit).\\nNet Income (Loss) Per Share Attributable to Common Stockholders\\nWe compute net income (loss) per share using the two-class method required for participating securities. The two-class method requires income available to\\ncommon stockholders for the period to be allocated between common stock and participating securities based upon their respective rights to receive dividends as if\\nall income for the period had been distributed.\\nOur restricted common stock, and common stock issued upon early exercise of stock options are participating securities. We consider restricted common stock\\nand any shares issued upon early exercise of stock options, subject to repurchase, to be participating securities because holders of such shares have non-forfeitable\\ndividend rights in the event a cash dividend is declared on common stock.\\nInsurance Reserves\\nWe use a combination of third-party insurance and self-insurance mechanisms, including a wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiary, to provide for the\\npotential liabilities for certain risks, including auto liability, uninsured and underinsured motorist, auto physical damage, general liability, and workers’\\ncompensation. The insurance reserves is the liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, which represents the estimate of the ultimate unpaid obligation\\nfor risks retained by us and includes an amount for case reserves related to reported claims and an amount for losses incurred but not reported as of the balance\\nsheet date. The estimate of the ultimate unpaid obligation utilizes generally accepted actuarial methods applied to historical claim and loss experience.\\n92\\nIn addition, we use assumptions based on actuarial judgment related to claim and loss development patterns and expected loss costs, which consider frequency\\ntrends, severity trends, and relevant industry data. These reserves are continually reviewed and adjusted as experience develops and new information becomes\\nknown. Adjustments, if any, relating to accidents that occurred in prior years are reflected in the current year results of operations. Reserve amounts estimated to be\\nsettled within one year are recorded in short-term insurance reserves, with longer term settlements recorded in long-term insurance reserves on the consolidated\\nbalance sheets.\\nWhile management believes that the insurance reserve amount is adequate, the ultimate liability may be in excess of, or less than, the amount provided. All\\nestimates of ultimate losses and allocated loss adjustment expenses, and of resulting reserves, are subject to inherent variability caused by the nature of the\\ninsurance claim settlement process. Such variability is increased for us due to limited historical experience and the nature of the coverage provided. Actual results\\ndepend upon the outcome of future contingent events and can be affected by many factors, such as claims settlement processes and changes in the economic, legal,\\nand social environments. As a result, the net amounts that will ultimately be paid to settle the liability and when these amounts will be paid may vary from the\\nestimate provided on the consolidated balance sheets.\\nLoss Contingencies\\nWe are involved in legal proceedings, claims, and regulatory, indirect tax examinations or government inquiries and investigations that may arise in the\\nordinary course of business. Certain of these matters include speculative claims for substantial or indeterminate amounts of damages. We record a liability when we\\nbelieve that it is both probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. If we determine that a loss is reasonably possible and the\\nloss or range of loss can be reasonably estimated, we disclose the possible loss in the consolidated financial statements.\\nWe review the developments in our contingencies that could affect the amount of the provisions that have been previously recorded, and the matters and\\nrelated reasonably possible losses disclosed. We make adjustments to our provisions and changes to our disclosures accordingly to reflect the impact of\\nnegotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel, and updated information. Significant judgment is required to determine both the probability and the\\nestimated amount of loss.\\nThe outcomes of litigation, indirect tax examinations and investigations are inherently uncertain. Therefore, if one or more of these matters were resolved\\nagainst us for amounts in excess of management\\'s expectations, our results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows, including in a particular reporting\\nperiod in which any such outcome becomes probable and estimable, could be materially adversely affected.\\nWe recognize estimated losses from contingencies that relate to proceedings in which Drivers are the plaintiffs, or proceedings and regulatory penalties against\\nDrivers for which we elect to either pay on behalf of or reimburse Drivers, as a reduction of revenue in the consolidated statements of operations. All other\\nestimated losses from contingencies are recognized in general and administrative expenses.\\nLegal fees and other costs associated with such actions are expensed as incurred.\\nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\\nIn November 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-10, “Government Assistance (Topic 832): Disclosures by Business Entities about Government Assistance,”\\nwhich requires disclosures about transactions with a government that are accounted for by applying a grant or contribution accounting model by analogy. The\\nstandard is effective for public companies for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021. Early adoption is permitted. We adopted the ASU prospectively on\\nJanuary 1, 2022. The additional required annual disclosures did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted\\nIn October 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-08, “Business Combinations (Topic 805): Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts\\nwith Customers,” which requires entities to apply Topic 606 to recognize and measure contract assets and contract liabilities in a business combination as if it had\\noriginated the contracts. The standard is effective for public companies for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15,\\n2022. Early adoption is permitted. We will adopt this accounting standard update on January 1, 2023 and will apply the guidance prospectively for future\\nacquisitions.\\nIn June 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-03, “Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Fair Value Measurement of Equity Securities Subject to Contractual Sale\\nRestrictions,” which clarifies that contractual sale restrictions are not considered in measuring fair value of equity securities and requires additional disclosures for\\nequity securities subject to contractual sale restrictions. The standard is effective for public companies for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023. Early\\nadoption is permitted. This accounting standard update is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements as the amendments align\\nwith our existing policy.\\nIn September 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-04, “Liabilities—Supplier Finance Programs (Subtopic 405-50): Disclosure of Supplier Finance Program\\nObligations,” which requires entities that use supplier finance programs in connection with the purchase of goods and services to disclose sufficient information\\nabout the program. The amendments do not affect the recognition, measurement\\n93\\nor financial statement presentation of obligations covered by supplier finance programs. The standard is effective for public companies for fiscal years, and interim\\nperiods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2022, except for the amendment on roll-forward information, which is effective for fiscal years\\nbeginning after December 15, 2023. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of this accounting standard update on our consolidated\\nfinancial statements.\\nNote 2 – Revenue\\nThe following tables present our revenues disaggregated by offering and geographical region. Revenue by geographical region is based on where the\\ntransaction occurred. This level of disaggregation takes into consideration how the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows are affected\\nby economic factors (in millions):\\nYear Ended December 31,\\n2020\\n2021\\n2022\\nMobility revenue \\n$\\n6,089\\xa0\\n$\\n6,953\\xa0\\n$\\n14,029\\xa0\\nDelivery revenue \\n3,904\\xa0\\n8,362\\xa0\\n10,901\\xa0\\nFreight revenue\\n1,011\\xa0\\n2,132\\xa0\\n6,947\\xa0\\nAll Other revenue\\n135\\xa0\\n8\\xa0\\n—\\xa0\\nTotal revenue\\n$\\n11,139\\xa0\\n$\\n17,455\\xa0\\n$\\n31,877\\xa0\\n We offer subscription memberships to end-users including Uber One, Uber Pass, Rides Pass, and Eats Pass (“Subscription”).

Mobility revenue also includes immaterial revenue\\nstreams such as our financial partnerships products.\\nAdditionally, in certain markets where we are responsible for Mobility services, fees charged to end-users are also included in revenue, while payments to\\nDrivers in exchange for Mobility services are recognized in cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization.\\nDelivery Revenue\\nWe derive revenue for Delivery from Merchants’ and Couriers’ use of the Delivery platform and related service to facilitate and complete Delivery\\ntransactions.\\nAdditionally, in certain markets where we are responsible for Delivery services, delivery fees charged to end-users are also included in revenue, while\\npayments to Couriers in exchange for Delivery services are recognized in cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization. Delivery also includes\\nadvertising revenue from sponsored listing fees paid by Merchants and brands in exchange for advertising services.\\nFreight Revenue\\nFreight revenue consists of revenue from freight transportation services provided to shippers. During the fourth quarter of 2021, we completed the acquisition\\nof Transplace, and as a result, our Freight revenue now also includes revenue from transportation management. Refer to Note 17 – Business Combinations for\\nfurther information on the Transplace acquisition.\\nAll Other Revenue\\nPrior to 2022, All Other revenue primarily includes collaboration revenue related to our ATG business and revenue from our New Mobility offerings and\\nproducts.\\nATG collaboration revenue was within the scope of ASC 808, Collaborative Arrangements, and related to a three-year joint\\n(1)\\n(1)\\n(1)\\n94\\ncollaboration agreement we entered into in 2019. During the first quarter of 2021, we completed the sale of Apparate USA LLC (“Apparate” or the “ATG\\nBusiness”) to Aurora Innovation, Inc. (“Aurora”). Refer to Note 18 – Divestitures for further information.\\nNew Mobility offerings and products provided users access to rides through a variety of modes, including dockless e-bikes and e-scooters (“New Mobility”),\\nplatform incubator group offerings and other immaterial revenue streams. New Mobility revenue was accounted for as an operating lease as defined under ASC\\n842. After the JUMP divestiture during the second quarter of 2020, revenue from New Mobility products, including dockless e-bikes, was no longer material.\\nContract Balances and Remaining Performance Obligation\\nContract liabilities represent consideration collected prior to satisfying our performance obligations. As of December 31, 2022, we had $133 million of contract\\nliabilities included in accrued and other current liabilities as well as other long-term liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. Revenue recognized from these\\ncontracts during 2020, 2021 and 2022 was not material.\\nOur remaining performance obligation for contracts with an original expected length of greater than one year is expected to be recognized as follows (in\\nmillions):\\nLess Than or Equal To 12 Months\\nGreater Than 12 Months\\nTotal\\nAs of December 31, 2022\\n$\\n25\\xa0 $\\n106\\xa0 $\\n131\\xa0\\nNote 3 – Investments and Fair Value Measurement\\nInvestments\\nOur investments on the consolidated balance sheets consisted of the following as of December 31, 2021 and 2022 (in millions):\\nAs of December 31,\\n2021\\n2022\\nClassified as short-term investments:\\nMarketable debt securities :\\nU.S. government and agency securities\\n$\\n—\\xa0\\n$\\n44\\xa0\\nCommercial paper\\n—\\xa0\\n46\\xa0\\nCorporate bonds\\n—\\xa0\\n13\\xa0\\nShort-term investments\\n$\\n—\\xa0\\n$\\n103\\xa0\\nClassified as restricted investments:\\nMarketable debt securities :\\nU.S. government and agency securities\\n$\\n—\\xa0\\n$\\n1,614\\xa0\\nRestricted investments\\n$\\n—\\xa0\\n$\\n1,614\\xa0\\nClassified as investments:\\nNon-marketable equity securities:\\nDidi\\n$\\n—\\xa0\\n$\\n1,802\\xa0\\nOther \\n315\\xa0\\n312\\xa0\\nMarketable equity securities\\nDidi\\n2,838\\xa0\\n—\\xa0\\nGrab\\n3,821\\xa0\\n1,726\\xa0\\nAurora\\n3,388\\xa0\\n364\\xa0\\nOther\\n1,312\\xa0\\n87\\xa0\\nNotes receivable from a related party \\n132\\xa0\\n110\\xa0\\nInvestments\\n$\\n11,806\\xa0\\n$\\n4,401\\xa0\\nExcluding marketable debt securities classified as cash equivalents and restricted cash equivalents.\\nThese balances include certain investments recorded at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in earnings due to the election of the fair value option\\nof accounting for financial instruments.\\n(1)\\n(1)\\n(2)\\n(2), (3)\\n(1) \\n(2) \\n95\\nConsists of the Lime Convertible Note.

There\\nwere no impacts to our: balance of cash and cash equivalents; restricted cash and cash equivalents; restricted cash and cash equivalents, non-current; financial\\nposition; liquidity; results of operations; comprehensive loss; cash flows; or the change in equity. We determined this to be an immaterial error. The December 31,\\n2021 balance of money market funds in the table above has been revised to $3.2 billion. As of both March 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, the money market funds\\nbalance in the fair value level hierarchy table should have been $3.1 billion. As of December 31, 2022, the decrease in money market funds was primarily driven by\\nreinvesting funds into marketable debt securities and cash deposits.\\nFor further information, see Note 4 - Equity Method Investments.\\nThe amortized cost of our debt securities measured at fair value on a recurring basis approximates fair value as of December\\xa031, 2022. We did not record any\\nmaterial unrealized gains or losses, or credit losses as of December\\xa031, 2022. The weighted-average remaining maturity of our debt securities was less than one\\nyear as of December\\xa031, 2022.\\nFair Value Hierarchy\\nWe measure our cash equivalents and certain investments at fair value. Level 1 instrument valuations are based on quoted market prices of the identical\\nunderlying security. Level 2 instrument valuations are obtained from readily available pricing sources for comparable instruments, identical instruments in less\\nactive markets, or models using market observable inputs. Level 3 instrument valuations are valued based on unobservable inputs and other estimation techniques\\ndue to the absence of quoted market prices, inherent lack of liquidity and the long-term nature of such financial instruments.\\nOur Level 3 non-marketable equity securities as of December 31, 2021 and 2022 primarily consist of common stock investments and redeemable preferred\\nstock investments in privately held companies without readily determinable fair values.\\nDepending on the investee’s financing activity in a reporting period, management’s estimate of fair value may be primarily derived from the investee’s\\nfinancing transactions, such as the issuance of preferred stock to new investors. The price in these transactions generally provides the best indication of the\\nenterprise value of the investee. Additionally, based on the timing, volume, and other characteristics of the transaction, we may supplement this information by\\nusing other valuation techniques, including the guideline public company approach. The guideline public company approach relies on publicly available market\\ndata of comparable companies and uses comparative valuation multiples of the investee’s revenue (actual and forecasted), and therefore, unobservable input used in\\nthis valuation technique primarily consists of short-term revenue projections.\\nOnce the fair value of the investee is estimated, an option-pricing model (“OPM”), a common stock equivalent (“CSE”) method or a hybrid approach is\\nemployed to allocate value to various classes of securities of the investee, including the class owned by us. The model involves making assumptions around the\\ninvestees’ expected time to liquidity and volatility.\\n(3) \\n(1)\\n(2)\\n(1) \\n(2) \\n96\\nAn increase or decrease in any of the unobservable inputs in isolation, such as the security price in a significant financing transaction of the investee, could\\nresult in a material increase or decrease in our estimate of fair value. Other unobservable inputs, including short-term revenue projections, time to liquidity, and\\nvolatility are less sensitive to the valuation in the respective reporting periods, as a result of the primary weighting on the investee’s financing transactions. In the\\nfuture, depending on the weight of evidence and valuation approaches used, these or other inputs may have a more significant impact on our estimate of fair value.\\nWe determine realized gains or losses on the sale of equity and debt securities on a specific identification method.\\nDidi Investment\\nOn June 30, 2021, Didi started trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Accordingly, our investment in preferred shares of Didi, which was previously\\naccounted for under the measurement alternative on a non-recurring basis, was converted to ordinary shares with a readily determinable fair value and therefore\\nchanged to an investment measured at fair value on a recurring basis. As of December\\xa031, 2021, our Didi investment was classified as a marketable equity security\\nwith a readily determinable fair value (Level 1) in the table presenting our financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis. For the year\\nended December 31, 2021, we recognized an unrealized loss of $3.0 billion on this investment in other income (expense), net in our consolidated statements of\\noperations.\\nAs of December\\xa031, 2022, our Didi investment is classified as a non-marketable equity security and is measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis with a\\nreadily available price based on significant other observable inputs (Level 2). For further information, see the section titled “Didi Investment” below.\\nZomato Investment\\nIn July 2021, Zomato Media Private Limited (“Zomato”), in which we held preferred shares that were previously classified as non-marketable equity securities\\nand accounted for under the measurement alternative on a non-recurring basis, completed its IPO in India. Accordingly, our Zomato investment was converted to\\nordinary shares upon the completion of the IPO and was classified as a marketable equity security with a readily determinable fair value (Level 1) in the table\\npresenting our financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis at December\\xa031, 2021. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we\\nrecognized an unrealized gain of $991 million on this investment in other income (expense), net in our consolidated statement of operations. As of December\\xa031,\\n2021, the carrying value of the investment was $1.1 billion. Our investment was subject to a lock-up period in which our ability to sell was restricted until July\\n2022.\\nDuring the third quarter of 2022, we completed the sale of $418 million of our entire stake in Zomato ordinary shares for net proceeds of $376 million and\\nrecognized an immaterial loss from this transaction in other income (expense), net in our consolidated statement of operations.\\nAurora Investment\\nOn January 19, 2021, we completed the sale of our ATG Business to Aurora. As consideration for the sale of our ATG Business to Aurora, we received\\ncommon stock in Aurora. Concurrently, we invested in Aurora’s preferred stock. For further information, refer to Note 18 – Divestitures.\\nWe held one seat on Aurora’s board of directors and had the ability to hold a second seat, which, along with our common and preferred stock ownership (our\\n“Aurora Investments”) generate significant influence. We elected to apply the fair value option to our Aurora common stock and preferred stock investments in\\norder to provide consistency of accounting treatment to our Aurora Investments. The Aurora Investments are measured at fair value on a recurring basis with\\nchanges in fair value reflected in other income (expense), net, in the consolidated statements of operations.\\nOn November 3, 2021, Aurora completed its planned special purpose acquisition company (“SPAC”) merger with Reinvent Technology Partners Y, resulting in\\nAurora becoming a publicly traded company post combination. Upon the completion of the merger, all of our Aurora Investments converted into shares of the\\nnewly issued Class A common stock of the publicly traded company. In addition, our ownership was significantly diluted and we lost the ability to appoint a second\\nseat on Aurora’s board of directors. As a result, we no longer held significant influence over Aurora. As of December 31, 2021 and 2022, our Aurora Investment has\\nbeen classified as a marketable equity security with a readily determinable fair value (Level 1) in the table presenting our financial assets and liabilities measured at\\nfair value on a recurring basis. We recognized an unrealized gain of $1.6 billion and unrealized loss of $3.0 billion on this investment in other income (expense),\\nnet in our consolidated statements of operations for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2022, respectively.\\n97\\nSummarized financial information for Aurora for the year ended December\\xa031, 2021 is as follows (in millions):\\nResults of Operations Data\\nYear Ended\\nDecember 31, 2021\\nRevenue\\n$\\n83\\xa0\\nTotal operating expenses\\n813\\xa0\\nLoss from operations\\n(731)\\nNet loss\\n(755)\\nBalance Sheet Data\\nAs of\\nDecember 31, 2021\\nCurrent assets\\n$\\n1,677\\xa0\\nTotal assets\\n3,690\\xa0\\nCurrent liabilities\\n91\\xa0\\nTotal liabilities\\n348\\xa0\\nGrab Investment\\nDuring the first quarter of 2020, we determined the fair value of our available-for-sale debt securities in Grab had declined below their amortized cost based on\\nan analysis of the observed valuation declines of Grab’s publicly-traded competitive peer group and representative stock market indices. These observed inputs\\nwere considered indicative of changes in the fair value of the Grab securities. Using the analysis, we computed a downward market adjustment of 10% that was\\napplied to the valuation derived from Grab’s latest financing transaction which occurred earlier in the first quarter of 2020 and prior to the announcement of\\nCOVID-19 as a global pandemic, impacting global demand for Mobility services. As a result, the carrying value of the investment in Grab was reduced by\\n$230\\xa0million; $57 million reduced the previously recognized unrealized gain in other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax, and the remaining $173 million,\\nrepresenting the difference between the fair value and amortized cost of the securities, was recognized as an allowance for credit loss in the consolidated balance\\nsheet and a corresponding credit-related impairment charge recorded to other income (expense), net in the consolidated statement of operations. Due to the\\nsignificant uncertainty about Grab’s ability to repay the redemption amount of the securities on the redemption date, the amount expected to be collected was\\nconsidered to be less than the fair value of the securities. Therefore, during the first quarter of 2020, the entire decline in fair value below amortized cost was\\nconsidered to reflect a credit-related impairment charge.\\nThe fair value of our Grab investment recovered during the third quarter of 2020 as determined by referencing an equity financing transaction closed by the\\ninvestee during that quarter. As a result, we recognized a reversal of the previously recorded allowance for credit loss in the consolidated balance sheet and a\\ncorresponding reversal of the credit-related impairment charge to other income (expense), net in the consolidated statement of operations.\\nOn December 1, 2021, Grab completed its planned SPAC merger with Altimeter Growth Corporation, resulting in Grab becoming a publicly traded company\\npost combination. Upon the completion of the merger, our investment in Series G preferred shares of Grab, which was previously accounted for as an investment in\\nan available-for-sale debt security due to the redemption feature of the shares, converted into the newly issued Class A ordinary shares of the publicly traded\\ncompany. We recorded the fair value of our investment with changes in the fair value recorded in other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax through the date of\\nthe conversion. Upon the conversion, we released the accumulative pre-tax unrealized gains on the investment of $2.8\\xa0 billion recorded through other\\ncomprehensive income and recognized them as unrealized gains in other income (expense), net in our consolidated statement of operations for year ended\\nDecember 31, 2021. Subsequent to the conversion, we recognized unrealized losses of $1.2 billion and $2.1 billion on the investment in other income (expense),\\nnet in our consolidated statements of operations for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2022, respectively, for the fair value change of the equity security.\\nAs of December\\xa031, 2022, our Grab investment has been classified as a marketable equity security with a readily determinable fair value (Level 1) in the table\\npresenting our financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis.\\nLime Investments\\nOur ownership in Lime is comprised of Lime Common Stock, Lime 1-C Preferred Stock, Lime 1-C Preferred Stock Warrants, and the Lime Convertible Note\\n(collectively, the “2020 Lime Investments”). The 2020 Lime Investments were received as part of the transaction by which we divested of our JUMP business.\\nRefer to Note 18 – Divestitures for further information regarding the JUMP Divestiture and the 2020 Lime Investments. Our investment in Lime Common Stock\\nand representation on Lime’s board of directors gives us the ability to exercise significant influence over Lime. We elected to apply the fair value option to our\\nLime Common Stock investment and therefore we are applying fair value accounting to all of the 2020 Lime Investments which provides for consistency of\\naccounting treatment. The 2020 Lime Investments are measured at fair value on a recurring basis with changes in fair value reflected in earnings. In December\\n2021, we contributed an additional $50 million of cash to Lime in exchange for a second convertible secured note that may be converted into common or preferred\\nstock. The fair value of the 2020 Lime Investments as of December 31, 2021 of\\n98\\n$162 million was determined by referencing a financing transaction and used as an input to an OPM. Other key inputs to the OPM were discount rates of 22% and\\n28%, volatility of 70% and time to liquidity of 1.25 years.\\nThe fair value of our Lime investments as of December\\xa031, 2022 of $113 million was determined by referencing a financing transaction and used as an input to\\nan OPM. Other key inputs to the OPM were discount rates of 32% and 38%, volatility of 87% and time to liquidity of 1.50 years.\\nFinancial Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value Using Level 3 Inputs\\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of our financial assets and liabilities measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31,\\n2021 and 2022, using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) (in millions):\\nNon-marketable\\nDebt Securities\\nNon-marketable\\nEquity Securities\\nNotes Receivable\\nMLU B.V.

As a\\nresult, our investments have been classified as marketable equity securities with a readily determinable fair value (Level 1) in the table presenting our financial\\nassets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis. For further information, see the section titled “Aurora Investment” and “Grab Investment” above.\\nWe did not make any transfers into or out of Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy during the year ended December 31, 2022.\\nAssets Measured at Fair Value on a Non-Recurring Basis\\nNon-Financial Assets\\nOur non-financial assets, such as goodwill, intangible assets and property and equipment are adjusted to fair value when an impairment charge is recognized.\\nSuch fair value measurements are based predominately on Level 3 inputs.\\nNon-Marketable Equity Securities\\nOur non-marketable equity securities are investments in privately held companies without readily determinable fair values. The carrying value of our non-\\nmarketable equity securities are adjusted based on price changes from observable transactions of identical or similar securities of the same issuer (referred to as the\\nmeasurement alternative) or for impairment. Any changes in carrying value are recorded within other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of\\noperations. Non-marketable equity securities are classified within Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy because we estimate the fair value of these securities based on\\nvaluation methods, including the CSE and OPM methods, using the transaction price of similar securities issued by the investee adjusted for contractual rights and\\nobligations of the securities we hold.\\nThe following is a summary of unrealized gains and losses from remeasurement (referred to as upward or downward adjustments) recorded in other income\\n(expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations, and included as adjustments to the carrying value of non-marketable equity securities held during the\\nyears ended December 31, 2020, 2021 and 2022 based on the observable price in\\n99\\nan orderly transaction for the same or similar security of the same issuers (in millions):\\nYear Ended December 31,\\n2020\\n2021\\n2022\\nUpward adjustments\\n$\\n—\\xa0 $\\n71\\xa0\\n$\\n1,046\\xa0\\nDownward adjustments (including impairment)\\n(1,690)\\n—\\xa0\\n(641)\\nTotal unrealized gain (loss) for non-marketable equity securities\\n$\\n(1,690) $\\n71\\xa0\\n$\\n405\\xa0\\nWe evaluate our non-marketable equity securities for impairment at each reporting period based on a qualitative assessment that considers various potential\\nimpairment indicators. This evaluation consists of several factors including, but not limited to, an assessment of a significant adverse change in the economic\\nenvironment, significant adverse changes in the general market condition of the geographies and industries in which our investees operate, and other publicly\\navailable information that affect the value of our non-marketable equity securities. As a result of the deterioration in economic and market conditions arising from\\nCOVID-19, we determined an impairment indicator existed as of March 31, 2020 and the fair value of certain investments, primarily our investment in Didi, was\\nless than their carrying value.\\nDidi Investment\\nTo determine the fair value of our investment in Didi as of March 31, 2020, we utilized a hybrid approach, incorporating a CSE method along with an OPM,\\nweighted at 80% and 20%, respectively. The following table summarizes information about the significant unobservable inputs used in the valuation for our\\ninvestment in Didi as of March 31, 2020:\\nFair value method\\nKey unobservable input\\nCSE\\nMarket adjustment\\n(20)%\\nOPM\\nVolatility\\n39%\\nEstimated time to liquidity\\n2.0 years\\nMarket adjustment\\n(40)%\\nAs a result of the valuation performed, we recorded an impairment charge of $1.7 billion in other income (expense), net in our consolidated statement of\\noperations during the first quarter of 2020. There was no remeasurement event for our investment in Didi that occurred during the remainder of 2020.\\nDuring the first quarter of 2021, we completed the sale of $500 million of our Didi shares and realized immaterial gains from this transaction. In addition, we\\nrecorded unrealized gains of $71 million from remeasurement of the carrying value of the remaining Didi shares under the measurement alternative during the three\\nmonths ended March 31, 2021.\\nIn the second quarter of 2022, Didi completed their delisting from the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE Delisting”). We concluded the ordinary shares held\\nby us did not have a readily determinable fair value and should be accounted for under the measurement alternative method. As of December\\xa031, 2022, Didi\\nAmerican Depositary Shares (“ADS”) continue to be traded in the over-the-counter (“OTC”) market. We determined that the Didi ADS were similar to the ordinary\\nshares held prior to the NYSE Delisting. We then measured the investment to fair value based on the closing share price of the Didi ADS on the OTC market on\\nDecember\\xa031, 2022 as an observable transaction for similar securities. For the year ended December 31, 2022, we recognized an unrealized loss of $1.0 billion on\\nthis investment in other income (expense), net in our consolidated statement of operations.\\nWe did not record any realized gains or losses for our non-marketable equity securities measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis during the years ended\\nDecember 31, 2020 and 2022.\\nThe following table summarizes the total carrying value of our non-marketable equity securities measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis held, including\\ncumulative unrealized upward and downward adjustments made to the initial cost basis of the securities (in millions):\\nAs of December 31,\\n2021\\n2022\\nInitial cost basis\\n$\\n279\\xa0\\n$\\n1,700\\xa0\\nUpward adjustments\\n4\\xa0\\n1,052\\xa0\\nDownward adjustments (including impairment)\\n—\\xa0\\n(641)\\nTotal carrying value at the end of the period\\n$\\n283\\xa0\\n$\\n2,111\\xa0\\n100\\nNote 4 - Equity Method Investments\\nThe carrying value of our equity method investments were as follows (in millions):\\nAs of December 31,\\n2021\\n2022\\nMLU B.V.\\n$\\n751\\xa0\\n$\\n816\\xa0\\nMission Bay 3 & 4\\n38\\xa0\\n34\\xa0\\nOther\\n11\\xa0\\n20\\xa0\\nEquity method investments\\n$\\n800\\xa0\\n$\\n870\\xa0\\nMLU B.V. Investment\\nDuring 2018, we closed a transaction that contributed the net assets of our Uber Russia/CIS operations into a newly formed private limited liability company\\n(“MLU B.V.” or “Yandex.Taxi joint venture”), with Yandex and us holding ownership interests in MLU B.V. In exchange for consideration contributed, we\\nreceived a seat on MLU B.V.’s board and an initial 38% equity ownership interest consisting of common stock in MLU B.V. The investment was determined to be\\nan equity method investment due to our ability to exercise significant influence over MLU B.V. As of December 31, 2021 and 2022, our equity ownership interest\\nin MLU B.V. was 29% on a fully-diluted basis.\\nWe review for impairment whenever factors indicate that the carrying value of the equity method investment may not be recoverable. During the first quarter\\nof 2022, we determined that our investment in MLU B.V. was other-than-temporarily impaired, and recorded an impairment charge of $182 million in other income\\n(expense), net in the consolidated statement of operations. The impairment was primarily due to consensus projections of a protracted recession of the Russian\\neconomy as a result of Russia\\'s invasion of Ukraine. To determine the fair value of our investment in MLU B.V., we utilized a market approach referencing revenue\\nmultiples from publicly traded peer companies.\\n2021\\nOn August 30, 2021, we entered into an agreement with Yandex (the “Framework Agreement”) to restructure our joint ventures, MLU B.V. and Yandex Self\\nDriving Group B.V. (“SDG”) and we would sell to Yandex (i) our 4.5% equity interest in MLU B.V. and (ii) our entire equity interest in SDG (the “Initial\\nClosing”). Subsequent to the Initial Closing, Yandex spun-off, by way of demerger from MLU B.V., its delivery businesses: Yandex.Eats, Yandex.Lavka and\\nYandex.Delivery (collectively, “Demerged Businesses”). Immediately following the demerger, Yandex acquired all of our equity interest in the Demerged\\nBusinesses (“Demerger Share Closing”). In connection with the Framework Agreement, we granted Yandex an option (“MLU B.V. Call Option”) to acquire our\\nremaining equity interest in MLU B.V. during the two-year period following the Initial Closing. The total consideration paid by Yandex to us for the transaction\\nwas $1.0 billion in cash allocated as follows: (i) $276 million for our 4.5% of equity interest in MLU B.V.; (ii) $412 million for our equity interest in the Demerged\\nBusinesses; (iii) $230 million for the MLU B.V. Call Option; and (iv) the remaining immaterial amounts to our interest in SDG.\\nInitial Closing\\nDuring the third quarter of 2021 and pursuant to the Framework Agreement, we completed the sale of our entire equity interest in SDG and 4.5% of equity\\ninterest in MLU B.V. to Yandex. At the initial closing, we derecognized 4.5% of equity interest in MLU B.V. and recognized a gain of $106 million in other income\\n(expense), net on our consolidated statement of operations. The consideration allocated and gains recognized for the sale of our entire equity interest in SDG were\\nnot material.\\nDemerger Share Closing\\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2021 and pursuant to the Framework Agreement, MLU B.V. completed the spin-off of the Demerger Businesses and Yandex\\nacquired all of our equity interest in the Demerged Businesses. As a result, we derecognized our entire equity interest in the Demerged Businesses and recognized a\\ngain of $242 million in other income (expense), net in our consolidated statement of operations.\\nMLU B.V. Basis Difference\\nIncluded in the carrying value of MLU B.V. is the basis difference, net of amortization, between the original cost of the investment and our proportionate share\\nof the net assets of MLU B.V. The carrying value of the equity method investment is primarily adjusted for our share in the income or losses of MLU B.V. on a\\none-quarter lag basis and amortization of basis differences. Equity method goodwill and intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization are also adjusted for\\ncurrency translation adjustments representing fluctuations between the functional currency of the investee and the U.S. Dollar.\\n101\\nThe table below provides the composition of the basis difference (in millions):\\nAs of December 31, 2022\\nEquity method goodwill\\n$\\n320\\xa0\\nIntangible assets, net of accumulated amortization\\n31\\xa0\\nDeferred tax liabilities\\n(8)\\nCumulative currency translation adjustments\\n7\\xa0\\nBasis difference\\n$\\n350\\xa0\\nWe amortize the basis difference related to the intangible assets over the estimated useful lives of the assets that gave rise to the difference using the straight-\\nline method. The weighted-average life of the intangible assets is approximately 3.3 years and 3.0 years as of December 31, 2021 and 2022, respectively. Equity\\nmethod goodwill is not amortized.\\nMLU B.V. Call Option\\nThe MLU B.V. Call Option is recorded as a liability in accrued and other current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets, initially valued at $230 million\\nand measured at fair value on a recurring basis with changes in fair value recorded in other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations. As\\nof December 31, 2022, the exercise price of the MLU B.V. Call Option is approximately $1.9 billion, subject to certain adjustments based on the timing of the\\noption exercise.\\nAs of December 31, 2021, the fair value of the MLU B.V. Call Option was $193 million, including the recognition of an immaterial gain for the fair value\\nchange during the year ended December 31, 2021. To determine the fair value of the MLU B.V. Call Option as of December 31, 2021, we used a lattice model\\nwhich simulated multiple scenarios of the exercise behaviors and the corresponding strike prices over the term of the call option. Key inputs to the lattice model\\nwere underlying business value, option term of 1.7 years, volatility of 50%, risk-free interest rates, and strike price (Level 3).\\nAs of December 31, 2022, the fair value of the MLU B.V. Call Option was $2 million. We recorded a $191 million net gain for the fair value change during the\\nyear ended December 31, 2022. To determine the fair value of the MLU B.V. Call Option as of December 31, 2022, we used a lattice model which simulated\\nmultiple scenarios of the exercise behaviors and the corresponding strike prices over the term of the call option. Key inputs to the lattice model were: the\\nunderlying business value; option term of 0.7 years; volatility of 65%; risk-free interest rates; and strike price (Level 3).\\nMission Bay 3 & 4\\nThe Mission Bay 3 & 4 JV refers to Event Center Office Partners, LLC (“ECOP”), a joint venture entity established in 2018, by Uber and two companies\\n(“LLC Partners”) to manage the construction and operation of two office buildings owned by two ECOP wholly-owned subsidiaries. We contributed $136 million\\ncash in exchange for a 45% interest in ECOP. The two LLC Partners own 45% and 10%, respectively. The equity ownership interest in ECOP remained at 45% as\\nof December 31, 2021 and 2022.\\nIn March 2020, the two ECOP wholly-owned subsidiaries took out new loans. Upon closing of the new financing, the proceeds were used to first pay off the\\nexisting construction loan, then to cover the required operation reserve as well as various financing costs, and last, the remaining proceeds were distributed back to\\nUber and the LLC Partners based on their ownership percentage. As a result, Uber received $91 million from the ECOP as a return of capital investment, and\\nreduced the investment carrying value by the same amount.\\nWe have significant influence over ECOP and we account for our investment in ECOP under the equity method. At each reporting period and a quarter in\\narrears, we adjust the carrying value of our investment to reflect our proportionate share of ECOP’s income or loss, and any impairments, with a corresponding\\ncredit or debit, respectively, to income or loss from equity method investment, net of tax in the consolidated statements of operations. During 2019, the construction\\nwas completed and leasing activities commenced, During 2020, 2021 and 2022 an immaterial amounts of equity earnings were recognized. During 2021 and 2022,\\nwe incurred immaterial amounts of lease payments with ECOP, which is a related party. As of December 31, 2021 and 2022, we determined that there were no\\nimpairments of our investment in ECOP.\\nNote 5 – Property and Equipment, Net\\n102\\nThe components of property and equipment, net were as follows (in millions):\\nAs of December 31,\\n2021\\n2022\\nLand\\n$\\n65\\xa0\\n$\\n65\\xa0\\nBuilding and site improvements\\n737\\xa0\\n739\\xa0\\nLeasehold improvements\\n594\\xa0\\n609\\xa0\\nComputer equipment\\n468\\xa0\\n529\\xa0\\nLeased computer equipment\\n650\\xa0\\n712\\xa0\\nLeased vehicles\\n7\\xa0\\n11\\xa0\\nInternal-use software\\n258\\xa0\\n389\\xa0\\nFurniture and fixtures\\n99\\xa0\\n94\\xa0\\nConstruction in progress\\n157\\xa0\\n219\\xa0\\nTotal\\n3,035\\xa0\\n3,367\\xa0\\nLess: Accumulated depreciation and amortization\\n(1,182)\\n(1,285)\\nProperty and equipment, net\\n$\\n1,853\\xa0\\n$\\n2,082\\xa0\\nAmounts in construction in progress represent buildings, leasehold improvements, assets under construction, and other assets not placed in service.\\nDepreciation expense relating to property and equipment was $364 million, $393 million, and $346 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2021 and\\n2022, respectively. Included in these amounts were depreciation expense for leased computer equipment in the amount of $198 million, $217 million, and $186\\nmillion for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2021 and 2022, respectively. Accumulated depreciation and amortization included $390 million and $305 million\\nof leased computer equipment depreciation as of December 31, 2021 and 2022, respectively.\\nAmortization of capitalized software development costs was not material for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2021 and 2022.\\nNote 6 - Leases\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nOur leases primarily include corporate offices, data centers, and servers. The lease term of operating and finance leases vary from less than a year to 76 years.\\nWe have leases that include one or more options to extend the lease term for up to 14 years as well as options to terminate the lease within one year.

The Headquarters consists of two adjacent office buildings totaling approximately 423,000 rentable square\\nfeet. In connection with the JV arrangement, we acquired a 49% interest in the JV, the principal asset of which was the Land.\\nIn 2016, we and the JV Partner agreed to dissolve the JV and terminate our commitment to the lease of the Headquarters (together “the real estate transaction”)\\nand we retained a 49% indirect interest in the Land (“Indirect Interest”). Under the terms of the real estate transaction, we obtained the rights and title to the\\npartially constructed building, completed the development of the two office buildings and retained a 100% ownership in the buildings. In connection with the real\\nestate transaction, we also executed two 75-year land lease agreements (“Land Leases”). As of December\\xa031, 2022, commitments under the Land Leases total $128\\nmillion until February 2032. After 2032, the annual rent amount will adjust annually based on the prevailing consumer price index.\\nThe real estate transaction is accounted for as a financing transaction of our 49% Indirect Interest due to our continuing involvement through a purchase option\\non the Indirect Interest. As a financing transaction, the cash and deferred sales proceeds received from the real estate transaction are recorded as a financing\\nobligation. As of December\\xa031, 2022, our Indirect Interest of $65 million is included in property and equipment, net and a corresponding financing obligation of\\n$76 million is included in other long-term liabilities. Future land lease payments of $1.7 billion is allocated 49% to the financing obligation of the Indirect Interest\\nand 51% to the operating lease of land.\\nFuture minimum payments related to the financing obligations as of December\\xa031, 2022 are summarized below (in millions):\\nFuture Minimum Payments\\nFiscal Year Ending December 31,\\n2023\\n$\\n6\\xa0\\n2024\\n6\\xa0\\n2025\\n7\\xa0\\n2026\\n7\\xa0\\n2027\\n7\\xa0\\nThereafter\\n806\\xa0\\nTotal\\n$\\n839\\xa0\\nNote 7 – Goodwill and Intangible Assets\\nGoodwill\\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, we completed the acquisition of The Drizly Group, Inc.

The $2.6 billion is comprised of (i) a $1.1 billion tranche with a maturity date of February\\xa025, 2027, replacing the\\n2016 Senior Secured Term Loan as a Refinancing Term Loan (the “2027 Refinanced Term Loan”), and (ii) a $1.5 billion tranche with a maturity date of April\\xa04,\\n2025, replacing the 2018 Senior Secured Term Loan as an Incremental Term Loan (the “2025 Refinanced Term Loan”). The interest rate for the 2027 Refinanced\\nTerm Loan and the 2025 Refinanced Term Loan is the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) plus 3.50% per annum, subject to a floor of 0.00%. The\\nrefinancing transaction qualified as a debt modification that did not result in an extinguishment.\\nThe 2025 Refinanced Term Loan and the 2027 Refinanced Term Loan are guaranteed by certain of our material domestic restricted subsidiaries. The 2025\\nRefinanced Term Loan and the 2027 Refinanced Term Loan agreements contain customary covenants restricting our and certain of our subsidiaries’ ability to incur\\ndebt, incur liens and undergo certain fundamental changes. We were in compliance with all covenants as of December\\xa031, 2022. The loan is secured by certain of\\nour intellectual property and equity of certain material foreign subsidiaries.\\nThe fair values of our 2025 Refinanced Term Loan and 2027 Refinanced Term Loan were $1.4 billion and $1.1 billion, respectively, as of December\\xa031, 2022\\nand were determined based on quoted prices in markets that are not active, which is considered a Level 2 valuation input.\\n2025 Convertible Notes\\nIn December 2020, we issued $1.15 billion aggregate principal amount of 0% convertible senior notes due in 2025 (the “2025 Convertible Notes”), including\\nthe exercise in full by the initial purchasers of the 2025 Convertible Notes of their option to purchase\\n(1)\\n(1)\\n107\\nup to an additional $150 million principal amount of the 2025 Convertible Notes. The 2025 Convertible Notes were issued in a private placement to qualified\\ninstitutional buyers pursuant to Rule144A under the Securities Act. The 2025 Convertible Notes will mature on December\\xa015, 2025, unless earlier converted,\\nredeemed or repurchased.\\nHolders of the 2025 Convertible Notes may convert their notes at their option at any time prior to the close of business on the business day immediately\\npreceding September\\xa015, 2025 only under the following circumstances: (i) during any calendar quarter commencing after the calendar quarter ending on March 31,\\n2021 (and only during such calendar quarter), if the last reported sale price of our common stock for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during a\\nperiod of 30 consecutive trading days ending on, and including, the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter is greater than or equal to 130%\\nof the conversion price on each applicable trading day; (ii) during the five business day period after any ten consecutive trading day period (the “measurement\\nperiod”) in which the trading price (as defined below) per $1,000 principal amount of notes for each trading day of the measurement period was less than 98% of\\nthe product of the last reported sale price of our common stock and the conversion rate on each such trading day; (iii) if we call such notes for redemption, at any\\ntime prior to the close of business on the scheduled trading day immediately preceding the applicable redemption date; or (iv) upon the occurrence of specified\\ncorporate events. On or after September\\xa015, 2025 until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date, holders\\nmay convert all or any portion of their notes at any time, regardless of the foregoing circumstances.\\nAs of December\\xa031, 2022, none of the conditions permitting the holders of the 2025 Convertible Notes to convert their notes early had been met. Therefore,\\nthe 2025 Convertible Notes are classified as long-term.\\nThe initial conversion rate is 12.3701 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of notes, equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately\\n$80.84 per share of common stock. The conversion rate will be subject to adjustment in some events but will not be adjusted for any accrued and unpaid special\\ninterest.\\nUpon conversion of the 2025 Convertible Notes, we will pay or deliver, as the case may be, cash, shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and\\nshares of our common stock, at our election. We may not redeem the notes prior to December\\xa020, 2023. We may redeem for cash all or any portion of the notes, at\\nour option, on or after December\\xa020, 2023 if the last reported sale price of our common stock has been at least 130% of the conversion price then in effect for at\\nleast 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during any 30 consecutive trading day period (including the last trading day of such period) ending on, and\\nincluding, the trading day immediately preceding the date on which we provide notice of redemption at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount\\nof the notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid special interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date.\\nThe indenture governing the 2025 Convertible Notes does not contain any financial or operating covenants or restrictions on the payments of dividends, the\\nincurrence of indebtedness or the issuance or repurchase of securities by us or any of our subsidiaries.\\nPrior to the adoption of ASU 2020-06, the proceeds from the issuance of the 2025 Convertible Notes were allocated between the conversion feature recorded\\nas equity and the liability for the notes themselves. The difference of $243 million between the principal amount of the 2025 Convertible Notes and the liability\\ncomponent (the “debt discount”) was amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method over the term of the 2025 Convertible Notes. The equity\\ncomponent of the 2025 Convertible Notes was included in additional paid-in capital in the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2020 and was not\\nremeasured as it continued to meet the conditions for equity classification. To determine the fair value of the liability component of the 2025 Convertible Notes as\\nof the pricing date, we used the binomial model with inputs of time to maturity, conversion ratio, our stock price, risk free rate and volatility.\\nEffective January\\xa01, 2021, we early adopted ASU 2020-06 using the modified retrospective approach. The adoption of this standard resulted in a decrease to\\nadditional paid-in capital of $243 million and an increase to our 2025 Convertible Notes by the same amount. At adoption, there was no adjustment recorded to the\\nopening accumulated deficit. As a result of the adoption, starting on January\\xa01, 2021 interest expense is reduced as a result of accounting for the 2025 Convertible\\nNotes as a single liability measured at its amortized cost.\\nThe fair value of our 2025 Convertible Notes was $973 million as of December\\xa031, 2022 and was determined based on quoted prices in markets that are not\\nactive, which is considered a Level 2 valuation input.\\nSenior Notes\\nIn October 2018, we issued five-year notes with aggregate principal amount of $500 million due on November\\xa01, 2023 (the “2023 Senior Notes”) and eight-\\nyear notes with aggregate principal amount of $1.5 billion due on November\\xa01, 2026 (the “2026 Senior Notes”) in a private placement offering totaling $2.0 billion.\\nWe issued the 2023 and 2026 Senior Notes at par and paid approximately $9 million for debt issuance costs. The interest is payable\\xa0semi-annually\\xa0on May 1 and\\nNovember 1 of each year at 7.5% per annum and 8.0% per annum, respectively, beginning on May\\xa01, 2019, and the entire principal amount is due at the time of\\nmaturity.\\nIn September 2019, we issued eight-year notes with aggregate principal amount of $1.2 billion due on September\\xa015, 2027 (the “2027 Senior Notes”) in a\\nprivate placement to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule144A under the Securities Act. We issued the 2027 Senior Notes at par and paid approximately\\n$11 million for debt issuance costs. The interest is payable semi-annually in arrears on March 15 and September 15 of each year at 7.5% per annum, beginning on\\nMarch\\xa015, 2020, and the entire principal\\n108\\namount is due at the time of maturity.\\nIn May 2020, we issued five-year notes with an aggregate principal amount of $1.0 billion due on May\\xa015, 2025 (the “2025 Senior Notes”) in a private\\nplacement to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act. We issued the 2025 Senior Notes at par and paid approximately $8\\nmillion for debt issuance costs. The interest is payable semi-annually in arrears on May 15 and November 15 of each year at 7.5% per annum, beginning on\\nNovember\\xa015, 2020, and the entire principal amount is due at the time of maturity.\\nIn September 2020, we issued eight-year notes with an aggregate principal amount of $500 million due on January\\xa015, 2028 (the “2028 Senior Notes”) in a\\nprivate placement to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act. We issued the 2028 Senior Notes at par and paid approximately\\n$5 million for debt issuance costs. The interest is payable semi-annually in arrears on January 15 and July 15 of each year at 6.25% per annum, beginning on\\nJuly\\xa015, 2021, and the entire principal amount is due at the time of maturity. In October 2020, we used the net proceeds from this offering, along with cash on hand,\\nto redeem all of our outstanding 2023 Senior Notes. The redemption of the 2023 Senior Notes was for substantially identical 2028 Senior Notes. Following the\\nredemption, there were no 2023 Senior Notes outstanding.\\nIn August 2021, we issued eight-year notes with an aggregate principal amount of $1.5 billion due on August\\xa015, 2029 (the “2029 Senior Notes”) in a private\\nplacement to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act. We issued the 2029 Senior Notes at par and paid approximately $16\\nmillion for debt issuance costs. The interest is payable semi-annually in arrears on February 15 and August 15 of each year at 4.50% per annum, beginning on\\nFebruary\\xa015, 2022, and the entire principal amount is due at the time of maturity and therefore, the 2029 Senior Notes are classified as long-term. We used the net\\nproceeds from this offering to finance a portion of the consideration payable in cash, and certain related fees and expenses incurred, in connection with the\\nacquisition of Transplace, by our majority-owned subsidiary, Uber Freight Holding Corporation (“Freight Holding”). Refer to Note 17 – Business Combinations for\\nadditional information on the Transplace acquisition.\\nThe 2025, 2026, 2027, 2028 and 2029 Senior Notes (collectively “Senior Notes”) are guaranteed by certain of our material domestic restricted subsidiaries.\\nThe indentures governing the Senior Notes contain customary covenants restricting our and certain of our subsidiaries’ ability to incur debt and incur liens, as well\\nas certain financial covenants specified in the indentures.

On April\\xa0 4, 2022, we entered into an amendment to our Revolving Credit Facility to, among other things, (i) provide for\\napproximately $2.2 billion of revolving credit commitments, (ii) extend the maturity date for the commitments and loans from June\\xa013, 2023 to April\\xa04, 2027, (iii)\\nreduce the minimum liquidity covenant from $1.5 billion to $1.0 billion, (iv) replace the LIBOR based interest rate with a Secured Overnight Financing Rate\\n(“SOFR”) based interest rate, and (v) make certain other changes to the negative covenants under the amended revolving credit agreement. The Revolving Credit\\nFacility may be guaranteed by certain of our material domestic restricted subsidiaries based on certain conditions.

In these jurisdictions, we have recorded a valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets. We regularly review the deferred\\ntax assets for recoverability based on historical taxable income, projected future taxable income, the expected timing of the reversals of existing taxable temporary\\ndifferences and tax planning strategies by jurisdiction. Our judgment regarding future profitability may change due to many factors, including future market\\nconditions and the ability to successfully execute our business plans and/or tax planning strategies. Should there be a change in the ability to recover deferred tax\\nassets, our income tax provision would increase or decrease in the period in which the assessment is changed. We had a valuation allowance against net deferred\\ntax assets of $13.9 billion and $14.0 billion as of December 31, 2021 and 2022, respectively. In 2022, the increase in the valuation allowance was primarily\\nattributable to an increase in deferred tax assets resulting from the loss from operations, offset by the deferred tax impact from the transfer of certain intangible\\nassets among our wholly-owned subsidiaries.\\n(2) \\n(1)\\n(1)\\n116\\nThe indefinite carryforward period for net operating losses (\"NOLs\") means that indefinite-lived deferred tax liabilities can be considered as support for\\nrealization of deferred tax assets, which can affect the need to record or maintain a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets. As of December 31, 2021, we\\nrealized approximately $1.2 billion of our U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets as a result of our indefinite-lived deferred tax liabilities being used as a source\\nof income. As of December 31, 2022, we realized an immaterial amount of our U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets as a result of our indefinite-lived deferred\\ntax liabilities being used as a source of income.\\nAs of December\\xa031, 2022, we had U.S. federal NOL carryforwards of $1.9 billion that begin to expire in 2031 and $12.1 billion that have an unlimited\\ncarryover period. As of December\\xa031, 2022, we had U.S. state NOL carryforwards of $9.4 billion that started expiring in 2022 and $2.0 billion that have an\\nunlimited carryover period. As of December\\xa031, 2022, we had foreign NOL carryforwards of $633 million that begin to expire in 2023 and $17.7 billion that have\\nan unlimited carryover period.\\nAs of December\\xa031, 2022, we had U.S. federal research tax credit carryforwards of $843 million that begin to expire in 2028. We had U.S. state research tax\\ncredit carryforwards of $6 million that begin to expire in 2032 and $609 million that have an unlimited carryover period.\\nIn the event we experience an ownership change within the meaning of Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code (“IRC”), our ability to utilize net operating\\nlosses, tax credits and other tax attributes may be limited. The most recent analysis of our historical ownership changes was completed through December\\xa031, 2022.\\nBased on the analysis, we do not anticipate a current limitation on the tax attributes.\\nThe following table reflects changes in gross unrecognized tax benefits (in millions):\\nYear Ended December 31,\\n2020\\n2021\\n2022\\nUnrecognized tax benefits at beginning of year\\n$\\n1,797\\xa0\\n$\\n2,293\\xa0\\n$\\n2,657\\xa0\\nGross increases - current year tax positions\\n353\\xa0\\n239\\xa0\\n814\\xa0\\nGross increases - prior year tax positions\\n191\\xa0\\n134\\xa0\\n93\\xa0\\nGross decreases - prior year tax positions\\n(48)\\n(9)\\n(51)\\nGross decreases - settlements with tax authorities\\n—\\xa0\\n—\\xa0\\n—\\xa0\\nUnrecognized tax benefits at end of year\\n$\\n2,293\\xa0\\n$\\n2,657\\xa0\\n$\\n3,513\\xa0\\nAs of December\\xa031, 2022, approximately $198 million of unrecognized tax benefits, if recognized, would impact the effective tax rate. The remaining $3.3\\nbillion of the unrecognized tax benefits would not impact the effective tax rate due to the valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets.\\nWe recognize accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the provision for income taxes in the consolidated statements of\\noperations. The amount of interest and penalties accrued as of December 31, 2021 and 2022 was $18 million and $21 million, respectively.\\nAlthough the timing of the resolution and/or closure of audits is highly uncertain, it is reasonably possible that the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits\\ncould significantly change in the next 12 months. Given the number of years remaining subject to examination and the number of matters being examined, we are\\nunable to estimate the full range of possible adjustments to the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits. Any changes to unrecognized tax benefits recorded as of\\nDecember\\xa031, 2022 that are reasonably possible to occur within the next 12 months are not expected to be material.\\nWe are subject to taxation in the U.S. and various state and foreign jurisdictions. We are also under various state and other foreign income tax examinations.\\nWe believe that adequate amounts have been reserved in these jurisdictions. To the extent we have tax attribute carryforwards, the tax years in which the attribute\\nwas generated may still be adjusted upon examination by the federal, state or foreign tax authorities to the extent utilized in a future period.\\nAs of December\\xa031, 2022, the open tax years for our major tax jurisdictions are as follows:\\nJurisdiction\\nTax Years\\nU.S. Federal\\n2011 - 2022\\nU.S. States\\n2005 - 2022\\nBrazil\\n2017 - 2022\\nNetherlands\\n2019 - 2022\\nUnited Kingdom\\n2013 - 2022\\nAs of December\\xa031, 2022, the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability on the undistributed earnings from certain foreign subsidiaries that we intend to\\nindefinitely reinvest is not material.\\n117\\nNote 12 – Net Income (Loss) Per Share\\nBasic net loss per share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the periods presented. Diluted net\\nloss per share is computed by giving effect to all potential weighted average dilutive common stock. The dilutive effect of outstanding awards and convertible\\nsecurities is reflected in diluted net loss per share by application of the treasury stock method or if-converted method, as applicable.\\nWe take into account the effect on consolidated net loss per share of dilutive securities of entities in which we hold equity interests that are accounted for using\\nthe equity method.\\nThe following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted net loss per share attributable to common stockholders (in millions, except share amounts\\nwhich are reflected in thousands, and per share amounts):\\nYear Ended December 31,\\n2020\\n2021\\n2022\\nBasic net loss per share:\\nNumerator\\nNet loss including non-controlling interests\\n$\\n(6,788)\\n$\\n(570)\\n$\\n(9,138)\\nNet income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interests, net of tax\\n(20)\\n(74)\\n3\\xa0\\nNet loss attributable to common stockholders\\n$\\n(6,768)\\n$\\n(496)\\n$\\n(9,141)\\nDenominator\\nBasic weighted-average common stock outstanding\\n1,752,960\\xa0\\n1,892,546\\xa0\\n1,972,131\\xa0\\nBasic net loss per share attributable to common stockholders \\n$\\n(3.86)\\n$\\n(0.26)\\n$\\n(4.64)\\nDiluted net loss per share:\\nNumerator\\nNet loss attributable to common stockholders\\n$\\n(6,768)\\n$\\n(496)\\n$\\n(9,141)\\nNet loss attributable to Freight Holding convertible common shares non-controlling interest, net\\nof tax\\n—\\xa0\\n(44)\\n(41)\\nDiluted net loss attributable to common stockholders\\n$\\n(6,768)\\n$\\n(540)\\n$\\n(9,182)\\nDenominator\\nNumber of shares used in basic net loss per share computation\\n1,752,960\\xa0\\n1,892,546\\xa0\\n1,972,131\\xa0\\nWeighted-average effect of potentially dilutive securities:\\nAssumed redemption of Freight Holding convertible common shares, non-controlling interest\\n—\\xa0\\n2,973\\xa0\\n2,797\\xa0\\nDiluted weighted-average common stock outstanding\\n1,752,960\\xa0\\n1,895,519\\xa0\\n1,974,928\\xa0\\nDiluted net loss per share attributable to common stockholders \\n$\\n(3.86)\\n$\\n(0.29)\\n$\\n(4.65)\\nPer share amounts are calculated using unrounded numbers and therefore may not recalculate.\\nEffective January 1, 2021, we early adopted ASU 2020-06 using the modified retrospective approach. Upon adoption, we use the if-converted method and\\npresume share settlement for our 2025 Convertible Notes and our non-interest bearing unsecured convertible notes related to the acquisition of Careem (“Careem\\nNotes”) when calculating the dilutive effect of these notes.\\nThe following potentially dilutive outstanding securities were excluded from the computation of diluted net loss per share because their effect would have been\\nanti-dilutive for the periods presented, or issuance of such shares is contingent upon the satisfaction of\\n(1)\\n(1)\\n(1) \\n118\\ncertain conditions which were not satisfied by the end of the period (in thousands):\\nYear Ended December 31,\\n2020\\n2021\\n2022\\nFreight Holding contingently redeemable preferred stock\\n14,339\\xa0\\n10,070\\xa0\\n30,458\\xa0\\nConvertible notes\\n28,407\\xa0\\n21,740\\xa0\\n18,250\\xa0\\nRSUs\\n83,736\\xa0\\n71,461\\xa0\\n98,167\\xa0\\nStock options\\n28,734\\xa0\\n24,253\\xa0\\n20,039\\xa0\\nCommon stock subject to repurchase\\n28\\xa0\\n4,153\\xa0\\n2,606\\xa0\\nRSUs to settle fixed monetary awards\\n49\\xa0\\n—\\xa0\\n—\\xa0\\nShares committed under ESPP\\n2,451\\xa0\\n3,226\\xa0\\n3,878\\xa0\\nWarrants to purchase common stock\\n126\\xa0\\n73\\xa0\\n73\\xa0\\nTotal\\n157,870\\xa0\\n134,976\\xa0\\n173,471\\xa0\\nNote 13 – Segment Information and Geographic Information\\nWe determine our operating segments based on how the chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) manages the business, allocates resources, makes operating\\ndecisions and evaluates operating performance.\\nDuring the second quarter of 2020, we changed the name of the Rides segment to Mobility and the name of the Eats segment to Delivery. In addition, during\\nthe second quarter of 2020, we completed the divestiture of our JUMP business (the “JUMP Divestiture”), which comprised substantially all of the operations of\\nour Other Bets reportable segment. Subsequent to the JUMP Divestiture, the Other Bets segment no longer exists and the continuing activities previously included\\nin the Other Bets segment are immaterial for all periods presented. Certain of these other continuing business activities were migrated to our Mobility segment,\\nwhose prior period results were not restated because such business activities were immaterial. The other business activities that were not migrated represent an “all\\nother category separate from other reconciling items” and are presented within the All Other caption. The historical results of the former Other Bets segment are\\nincluded within the All Other caption. Refer to Note 18 – Divestitures for further information regarding the JUMP Divestiture.\\nIn January 2021, we sold our ATG Business to Aurora. Our ATG Business was included in the ATG and Other Technology Programs segment prior to this\\ntransaction. As a result of the sale, ATG and Other Technology Programs segment was no longer a reportable segment. Beginning in the first quarter of 2021,\\nresults of ATG and Other Technology Programs are included within All Other. Refer to Note 18 – Divestitures for further information regarding the sale of our ATG\\nBusiness.\\nAs of December 31, 2022, our three operating and reportable segments are as follows:\\nSegment\\nDescription\\nMobility\\nMobility products connect consumers with Drivers who provide rides in a variety of vehicles, such as cars, auto rickshaws,\\nmotorbikes, minibuses, or taxis. Mobility also includes activity related to our financial partnerships products and advertising.\\nDelivery\\nDelivery offerings allow consumers to search for and discover local restaurants, order a meal, and either pick-up at the restaurant or\\nhave the meal delivered. In certain markets, Delivery also includes offerings for grocery, alcohol and convenience store delivery as\\nwell as select other goods.\\nFreight\\nFreight connects Carriers with Shipper’s shipments available on our platform, and gives Carriers upfront, transparent pricing and the\\nability to book a shipment. Freight also includes transportation management and other logistics services offerings.\\nFor information about how our reportable segments derive revenue, as well as revenue grouped by offerings and geographical region refer to Note 2 –\\nRevenue.\\n119\\nOur segment operating performance measure is segment Adjusted EBITDA. The CODM does not evaluate operating segments using asset information and,\\naccordingly, we do not report asset information by segment. Segment Adjusted EBITDA is defined as revenue less the following expenses: cost of revenue,\\noperations and support, sales and marketing, and general and administrative and research and development expenses associated with our segments. Segment\\nAdjusted EBITDA also excludes non-cash items or items that management does not believe are reflective of our ongoing core operations (as shown in the table\\nbelow).\\nThe following table provides information about our segments and a reconciliation of total segment Adjusted EBITDA to loss from operations (in millions):\\nYear Ended December 31,\\n2020\\n2021\\n2022\\nSegment Adjusted EBITDA:\\nMobility\\n$\\n1,169\\xa0\\n$\\n1,596\\xa0\\n$\\n3,299\\xa0\\nDelivery\\n(873)\\n(348)\\n551\\xa0\\nFreight\\n(227)\\n(130)\\n—\\xa0\\nAll Other \\n(461)\\n(11)\\n—\\xa0\\nTotal Segment Adjusted EBITDA\\n(392)\\n1,107\\xa0\\n3,850\\xa0\\nReconciling items:\\nCorporate G&A and Platform R&D \\n(2,136)\\n(1,881)\\n(2,137)\\nDepreciation and amortization\\n(575)\\n(902)\\n(947)\\nStock-based compensation expense\\n(827)\\n(1,168)\\n(1,793)\\nLegal, tax, and regulatory reserve changes and settlements\\n35\\xa0\\n(526)\\n(732)\\nGoodwill and asset impairments/loss on sale of assets\\n(317)\\n(157)\\n(25)\\nAcquisition, financing and divestitures related expenses\\n(86)\\n(102)\\n(46)\\nAccelerated lease costs related to cease-use of ROU assets\\n(102)\\n(5)\\n(6)\\nCOVID-19 response initiatives\\n(106)\\n(54)\\n(1)\\nGain (loss) on lease arrangement, net\\n5\\xa0\\n—\\xa0\\n(7)\\nRestructuring and related charges, net\\n(362)\\n—\\xa0\\n(2)\\nLegacy auto insurance transfer \\n—\\xa0\\n(103)\\n—\\xa0\\nMass arbitration fees, net\\n—\\xa0\\n(43)\\n14\\xa0\\nLoss from operations\\n$\\n(4,863)\\n$\\n(3,834)\\n$\\n(1,832)\\nIncludes historical results of ATG and Other Technology Programs and New Mobility.\\n Excluding stock-based compensation expense.\\n Includes costs that are not directly attributable to our reportable segments.

Our allocation methodology is periodically evaluated and may change.\\n Refer to Note 1 – Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies for further information.\\nGeographic Information\\nRevenue by geography is based on where the trip or shipment was completed or meal delivered. Long-lived assets, net includes property and equipment, net\\nand operating lease right-of-use assets as well as the same asset class included within assets held for sale on the consolidated balance sheets. The following tables\\nset forth revenue and long-lived assets, net by geographic area as of and for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2021 and 2022 (in millions):\\nYear Ended December 31,\\n2020\\n2021\\n2022\\nUnited States\\n$\\n6,082\\xa0\\n$\\n9,058\\xa0\\n$\\n17,953\\xa0\\nUnited Kingdom \\n637\\xa0\\n551\\xa0\\n4,215\\xa0\\nAll other countries\\n4,420\\xa0\\n7,846\\xa0\\n9,709\\xa0\\nTotal Revenue\\n$\\n11,139\\xa0\\n$\\n17,455\\xa0\\n$\\n31,877\\xa0\\n(1)\\n(2), (3)\\n(4)\\n(1) \\n(2)\\n(3)\\n(4)\\n(1)\\n120\\nIn 2022, we modified our arrangements in certain markets and, as a result, concluded we are responsible for the provision of Mobility and Delivery services\\nto end-users in those markets. In these markets, we present revenue from end-users on a gross basis, as we control the service provided by Drivers to end-users,\\nwhile payments to Drivers in exchange for Mobility and Delivery services are recognized in cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization.

As of December 31, 2021 and 2022,\\nwe had recorded aggregate liabilities of $2.2 billion and $1.6 billion, respectively, of which $1.3 billion and $0.6 billion relate to non-income tax matters in accrued\\nand other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets for all of our legal, regulatory and non-income tax matters that were probable and reasonably\\nestimable.\\nWe are currently party to various legal and regulatory matters that have arisen in the normal course of business and include, among others, alleged independent\\ncontractor misclassification claims, Fair Credit Reporting Act (“FCRA”) claims, alleged background check violations, pricing and advertising claims, unfair\\ncompetition claims, intellectual property claims, employment discrimination and other employment-related claims, Telephone Consumer Protection Act (“TCPA”)\\nclaims, Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”) claims, data and privacy claims, securities claims, antitrust claims, challenges to regulations, and other matters.\\nWe have existing litigation, including class actions, Private Attorney General Act lawsuits, arbitration claims, and governmental administrative and audit\\nproceedings, asserting claims by or on behalf of Drivers that Drivers are misclassified as independent contractors. In connection with the enactment of California\\nState Assembly Bill 5 (“AB5”), we have received and expect to continue to receive - in California and in other jurisdictions - an increased number of\\nmisclassification claims. With respect to our outstanding legal and regulatory matters, based on our current knowledge, we believe that the ultimate amount or\\nrange of reasonably possible loss will not, either individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of\\noperations, or cash flows. The outcome of such legal matters is inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties. If one or more of these matters\\nwere resolved against us for amounts in excess of management\\'s expectations, our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows could be materially\\nadversely affected.\\nDriver Classification\\nCalifornia Attorney General Lawsuit\\nIn January 2020, AB5 went into effect. AB5 codifies a test to determine whether a worker is an employee under California law. The test is referred to as the\\n“ABC” test, and was originally handed down by the California Supreme Court in Dynamex Operations v. Superior Court in 2018. Under the ABC test, workers\\nperforming services for a hiring entity are considered employees unless the hiring entity can demonstrate three things: the worker (A) is free from the hiring entity’s\\ncontrol, (B) performs work that is outside the usual course of the hiring entity’s business, and (C) customarily engages in the independent trade, work or type of\\nbusiness performed for the hiring entity.\\nOn May 5, 2020, the California Attorney General, in conjunction with the city attorneys for San Francisco, Los Angeles and San Diego, filed a complaint in\\nSan Francisco Superior Court against Uber and Lyft, Inc. (“Lyft”). The complaint alleges drivers are misclassified, and seeks an injunction and monetary damages\\nrelated to the alleged competitive advantage caused by the alleged misclassification of drivers.\\nOn August 10, 2020, the Court issued a preliminary injunction order, prohibiting us from classifying drivers as independent contractors and from violating\\nvarious wage and hour laws. The injunction was stayed pending appeal. On October 22, 2020, the Court of Appeal affirmed the lower court’s ruling, and we filed a\\npetition for review of the decision with the California Supreme Court. The petition was based upon the passage of Proposition 22 by California voters in November\\n2020, and requested that the Court of Appeal opinion be vacated because AB5’s application to Uber was superseded by Proposition 22.\\nProposition 22 was a state ballot initiative that provides a framework for drivers that use platforms like ours to qualify as independent workers. As a result of\\nthe passage of Proposition 22, Drivers are able to maintain their status as independent contractors under California law, and we and our competitors are required to\\ncomply with the provisions of Proposition 22. Proposition 22 went into effect on December 16, 2020.\\n(1) \\n121\\nThe California Supreme Court declined the petition for review on February 10, 2021. The lawsuit was returned to the trial court following the appellate\\nproceedings on February 22, 2021. On April 12, 2021, the California Attorney General, Uber and Lyft filed a stipulation to dissolve the preliminary injunction with\\nthe trial court. On April 16, 2021, the trial court signed an order granting the stipulation. Although the preliminary injunction has been dissolved, the lawsuit\\nremains ongoing relating to claims by the California Attorney General for periods prior to enactment of Proposition 22. We have petitioned to stay this matter\\npending coordination with other California employment related matters, which was granted and a coordination judge was assigned. Since the assignment of the\\ncoordination judge, the case has been stayed pending appeal of the denial of a motion to compel arbitration. We intend to continue to vigorously defend ourselves.\\nOur chances of success on the merits are still uncertain and any reasonably possible loss or range of loss cannot be estimated.\\nIn addition, in January 2021, a petition was filed with the California Supreme Court by several drivers and a labor union alleging that Proposition 22 is\\nunconstitutional, which was denied. The same drivers and labor union have since filed a similar challenge in California Superior Court, and in August 2021, the\\nAlameda County Superior Court ruled that Proposition 22 is unconstitutional. On September 21, 2021, the State of California filed an appeal of that decision with\\nthe California Court of Appeal, and the Protect App-Based Drivers and Services organization, who intervened in the matter, has also filed an appeal. Oral argument\\nwas heard on December 13, 2022 and we await a decision.\\nMassachusetts Attorney General Lawsuit\\nOn July 9, 2020, the Massachusetts Attorney General filed a complaint in Suffolk County Superior Court against Uber and Lyft. The complaint alleges Drivers\\nare employees, and are entitled to protections under the wage and labor laws. The complaint was served on July 20, 2020 and Uber filed a motion to dismiss the\\ncomplaint on September 24, 2020, which was denied on March 25, 2021. A summary judgment motion was filed in September 2021, and we filed a motion in\\nwhich we argue that the motion is premature. The court granted our motion to defer the summary judgment motion on January 12, 2022 and summary judgment\\npapers will be fully briefed by August 29, 2023. Our chances of success on the merits are still uncertain and any reasonably possible loss or range of loss cannot be\\nestimated.\\nNew York Attorney General\\nThe New York Attorney General has alleged misclassification of drivers and related employment violations in New York by Uber as well as fraud related to\\ncertain deductions. The ultimate resolution of this matter is uncertain and the amount accrued for those matters is recorded within accrued and other current\\nliabilities on the consolidated balance sheets as of December\\xa031, 2022.\\nSwiss Social Security Rulings\\nSeveral Swiss administrative bodies have issued decisions in which they classify Drivers as employees of Uber Switzerland, Rasier Operations B.V. or of Uber\\nB.V. for social security or labor purposes. We are challenging each of them before the Social Security and Administrative Tribunals.\\nIn April 2021, a ruling was made that Uber Switzerland could not be held liable for social security contributions. The litigations with regards to Uber B.V. and\\nRasier Operations B.V. are still pending for years 2014 to 2021. In January 2022, the Social Security Tribunal of Zurich reclassified drivers who have used the App\\nin 2014 as dependent workers of Uber B.V. and Rasier Operations B.V. from a social security standpoint, but this ruling has been appealed before the Federal\\nTribunal and has no impact on our current operations. On June 3, 2022, the Federal Tribunal issued two rulings by which both Drivers and Couriers in the Canton\\nof Geneva are classified as employees of Uber BV, Uber Portier B.V. and Uber Switzerland GmbH.\\nFollowing this ruling, we received a request for information from the SVA Zürich that states that couriers shall be considered employees for social security\\npurposes since the launch of Uber Eats. The ultimate resolution of the matters before the social security authorities is uncertain and the amount accrued for those\\nmatters is recorded within accrued and other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets as of December\\xa031, 2022.\\nAslam, Farrar, Hoy and Mithu v. Uber B.V., Uber Britannia Ltd. and Uber London Ltd.\\nOn October 28, 2015, a claim by 25 Drivers, including Mr. Y. Aslam and Mr. J. Farrar, was brought in the UK Employment Tribunal against us asserting that\\nthey should be classified as “workers” (a separate category between independent contractors and employees) in the UK rather than independent contractors. The\\ntribunal ruled on October 28, 2016 that Drivers were workers whenever our App is switched on and they are ready and able to take trips based on an assessment of\\nthe App in July 2016. The Court of Appeal rejected our appeal in a majority decision on December 19, 2018. We appealed to the Supreme Court and a hearing at\\nthe Supreme Court took place in July 2020.\\nOn February 19, 2021, the Supreme Court of the UK upheld the tribunal ruling that the Drivers using the App in 2016 were workers for UK employment law\\npurposes. Damages include back pay including holiday pay and minimum wage, which will be assessed and quantified at a future hearing.\\nOn March 16, 2021, we announced that more than 70,000 drivers in the UK will be treated as workers, earning at least the National Living Wage when driving\\nwith Uber. They will also be paid for holiday time and all those eligible will be automatically\\n122\\nenrolled into a pension plan. We have also completed a settlement process with drivers in the UK to proactively resolve historical claims relating to their\\nclassification under UK law. Our portal for drivers to register for a settlement of historical holiday pay and national minimum wage liabilities closed on July 22,\\n2021 and we have extended offers to all drivers eligible for settlement who are not already represented by an attorney and have made payments to the drivers who\\naccepted our offers. Compensation hearings will take place for claimants who have not settled their historic claims, where the tribunal will assess our position on\\nthe correct approach to working time, expenses, and holiday pay.\\nOn June 23, 2021, we received a compliance notice from the UK pension regulator to facilitate our auto-enrollment implementation. We have completed the\\nenrollment of eligible drivers in the UK into a pension plan. While the ultimate resolution of these matters is uncertain, we have recorded an accrual for these\\nmatters within accrued and other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets as of December\\xa031, 2022.\\nSpain Labor Audits\\nLabor authorities in Spain opened audits reviewing the classification status of Couriers (in particular with regards to social security contributions). We have\\nreceived assessments as of December 31, 2022. We will proceed (or have proceeded) to appeal to the Court of First Instance for each of them. There are ongoing\\naudits for which we have not yet received an assessment. Our chances of success on the merits are still uncertain and any reasonably possible loss or range of loss\\ncannot be estimated for these ongoing audits.\\nOther Driver Classification Matters\\nAdditionally, we have received other lawsuits and governmental inquiries in other jurisdictions, and anticipate future claims, lawsuits, arbitration proceedings,\\nadministrative actions, and government investigations and audits challenging our classification of Drivers as independent contractors and not employees. We\\nbelieve that our current and historical approach to classification is supported by the law and intend to continue to defend ourselves vigorously in these matters.\\nHowever, the results of litigation and arbitration are inherently unpredictable and legal proceedings related to these claims, individually or in the aggregate, could\\nhave a material impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Regardless of the outcome, litigation and arbitration of these\\nmatters can have an adverse impact on us because of defense and settlement costs individually and in the aggregate, diversion of management resources and other\\nfactors.\\nState Unemployment Taxes\\nNew Jersey Department of Labor\\nIn 2018, the New Jersey Department of Labor (“NJDOL”) opened an audit reviewing whether Drivers were independent contractors or employees for purposes\\nof determining whether unemployment insurance regulations apply from 2014 through 2018. The NJDOL made an assessment on November 12, 2019, against both\\nRasier and Uber. Both assessments were calculated through November 15, 2019, but only calculated the alleged contributions, penalties, and interests owed from\\n2014 through 2018. The NJDOL has provided several assessments from February through October 2021. We have submitted payment for the principal revised\\namount of the assessment and have since reached agreement on and paid the remaining amounts allegedly owed from 2014 through 2018.\\nThe NJDOL has expressed its intention to audit later years. The ultimate resolution of the matter is uncertain and the amount accrued for those matters is\\nrecorded within accrued and other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets as of December\\xa031, 2022.\\nCalifornia Employment Development Department\\nIn 2014, the California employment development department (“CA EDD”) opened an audit to review whether drivers should be treated as employees or\\nindependent contractors. The department issued an assessment in 2016 for the periods of 2013 - 2015 and we have since reached an agreement with the CA EDD\\nfor this period. In 2022, we have received requests for information related to an audit of a subsequent period, which covers the fourth quarter of 2017 through the\\nfourth quarter of 2020. We have also received an audit for years 2018 - 2020 covering couriers who used the Postmates platform. The ultimate resolution of the\\nmatter is uncertain and the amount accrued for those matters is recorded within accrued and other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets as of\\nDecember\\xa031, 2022.\\nNew York Department of Labor\\nIn February 2020, the New York Department of Labor (“NYDOL”) opened an audit reviewing whether Drivers were independent contractors or employees for\\npurposes of determining whether unemployment insurance regulations apply from 2013 through 2020. The NYDOL issued an assessment in November 2022,\\nagainst Uber. The ultimate resolution of the matter is uncertain and the amount accrued for those matters is recorded within accrued and other current liabilities on\\nthe consolidated balance sheets as of December\\xa031, 2022.\\nNon-Income Tax Matters\\nWe recorded an estimated liability for contingencies related to non-income tax matters and are under audit by various domestic and foreign tax authorities with\\nregard to such matters.\\n123\\nThe subject matter of these contingent liabilities and non-income tax audits primarily arise from the characterization for tax purposes of the transactions on the\\nplatform, as well as the tax treatment of certain employee benefits and employment taxes related to our Drivers and Couriers. In jurisdictions with disputes\\nconnected to transactions on the platform, disputes involve the applicability of transactional taxes (such as sales tax, VAT, GST and similar taxes) or gross receipts\\ntaxes. In jurisdictions with disputes connected to employment taxes, disputes involve the applicability of withholding taxes related to employment taxes or back-up\\nwithholding on payments made to Drivers, Couriers, and Merchants.\\nOur estimated liability is inherently subjective due to the complexity and uncertainty of these matters and the judicial processes in certain jurisdictions;\\ntherefore, the final outcome could be materially different from the estimated liability recorded.\\nOn October 31, 2022, we settled our UK VAT dispute with the HMRC, the UK tax regulator, for all periods prior to March 14, 2022. As a result of the\\nsettlement agreement, these prior periods are closed to assessment and Uber made a payment of $733 million (GBP 613 million) in the fourth quarter of 2022 for\\nthis resolution.\\nAs of March 14, 2022, we modified our operating model in the UK, such that as of that date Uber UK is a merchant of transportation and is required to remit\\nVAT. Uber UK is remitting VAT under the Value Added (Tour Operators) Order 1987 (“VAT Order 1987”), which allows for VAT remittance on a calculated\\nmargin, rather than on Gross Bookings. As part of our ongoing discussions with HMRC, they have indicated that they are reviewing our VAT filings. The HMRC\\nmay disagree with our application of VAT Order 1987, but due to the complexity and uncertainty of these matters and the judicial processes, any reasonably\\npossible loss or range of loss cannot be estimated.\\nOther Legal and Regulatory Matters\\nWe have been and continue to be subject to various government inquiries and investigations surrounding the legality of certain of our business practices,\\ncompliance with antitrust, anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws (including Foreign Corrupt Practices Act) and other global regulatory requirements, labor laws,\\nsecurities laws, data protection and privacy laws, consumer protection laws, environmental laws, and the infringement of certain intellectual property rights. We\\nhave investigated and continue to investigate many of these matters and we are implementing a number of recommendations to our managerial, operational and\\ncompliance practices, as well as strengthening our overall governance structure. In many cases, we are unable to predict the outcomes and implications of these\\ninquiries and investigations on our business which could be time consuming, costly to investigate and require significant management attention. Furthermore, the\\noutcome of these inquiries and investigations could negatively impact our business, reputation, financial condition and operating results, including possible fines\\nand penalties and requiring changes to operational activities and procedures.\\nIndemnifications\\nIn the ordinary course of business, we often include standard indemnification provisions in our arrangements with third parties. Pursuant to these provisions,\\nwe may be obligated to indemnify such parties for losses or claims suffered or incurred in connection with their activities or non-compliance with certain\\nrepresentations and warranties made by us. In addition, we have entered into indemnification agreements with our officers, directors, and certain current and former\\nemployees, and our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain certain indemnification obligations. It is not possible to determine the maximum potential loss\\nunder these indemnification provisions / obligations because of the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular situation.\\nNote 15 – Variable Interest Entities\\nVIEs are legal entities that lack sufficient equity to finance their activities without future subordinated financial support.\\nConsolidated VIEs\\nWe consolidate VIEs in which we hold a variable interest and are the primary beneficiary. We are the primary beneficiary because we have the power to direct\\nthe activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of these VIEs. As a result, we consolidate the assets and liabilities of these consolidated\\nVIEs.\\nTotal assets included on the consolidated balance sheets for our consolidated VIEs as of December 31, 2021 and 2022 were $3.9 billion and $3.9 billion,\\nrespectively. Total liabilities included on the consolidated balance sheets for these VIEs as of December 31, 2021 and 2022 were $1.0 billion and $789 million,\\nrespectively.\\nFreight Holding\\nIn July 2018, we created a new majority-owned subsidiary, Uber Freight Holding Corporation (“Freight Holding”). The purpose of Freight Holding is to\\nperform the business activities of the Freight operating segment. The Freight Holding stock held by us was determined to be a variable interest.\\nIn October 2020, Freight Holding entered into a Series A preferred stock purchase agreement (“2020 Freight Series A Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement”)\\nwith outside investor (“2020 Freight Series A Investor”) to sell shares of Series A Preferred Stock (“Freight Series A”).\\nIn July 2021, we entered into a Freight Series A preferred stock purchase agreement and sold shares of Freight Series A to The Public Investment Fund, which\\nis an investor in Uber.\\n124\\nIn November 2021, Freight Holding entered into a series A-1 stock purchase agreement (“2021 Series A-1 Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement”) with outside\\ninvestors (“Freight Series A-1 Investors”) to sell shares of Series A-1 convertible preferred stock of Freight Holding (“Freight Series A-1”). Neither the Freight\\nSeries A or Freight Series A-1 investments changed the conclusion that Freight Holding is a consolidated VIE. As of December 31, 2021 and 2022, we continue to\\nown the majority of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Freight Holding and report non-controlling interest as further described in Note 16 – Non-\\nControlling Interests.\\nDivestiture of ATG Business and Aurora Investments\\nIn 2019, we contributed certain of our subsidiaries and certain assets and liabilities related to our autonomous vehicle technologies (excluding liabilities arising\\nfrom certain indemnification obligations related to the Levandowski arbitration and any remediation costs associated with certain obligations that may arise as a\\nresult of the Waymo settlement) to Apparate in exchange for common units representing 100% ownership interest in Apparate. Subsequent to the formation of\\nApparate, Apparate entered into a Class A Preferred Unit Purchase Agreement (“Preferred Unit Purchase Agreement”) with SVF Yellow (USA) Corporation\\n(“SoftBank”), Toyota Motor North America, Inc. (“Toyota”), and DENSO International America, Inc. (“DENSO”). Preferred units were issued in 2019 to\\nSoftBank, Toyota, and DENSO and provided the investors with an aggregate 13.8% initial ownership interest in Apparate on an as-converted basis. The common\\nunits held by us in Apparate were determined to be a variable interest. The purpose of Apparate was to develop and commercialize autonomous vehicle and\\nridesharing technologies and Apparate’s results were part of All Other. Refer to Note 13 – Segment Information and Geographic Information for further\\ninformation.\\nAs of December 31, 2020, we consolidated the ATG Business’ assets and liabilities and reported non-controlling interests.\\nIn January 2021, we completed the sale of the ATG Business to Aurora. Refer to the section titled “Unconsolidated VIEs” below for additional information on\\nAurora. Refer to Note 18 – Divestitures for further information on the sale of the ATG Business.\\nCareem Qatar and Morocco\\nOn January 2, 2020, we completed the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of Careem and certain of its subsidiaries pursuant to an asset purchase\\nagreement (the “Asset Purchase Agreement”) in countries where regulatory approval was obtained or which did not require regulatory approval. The assets and\\noperations in Qatar and Morocco (collectively “Non-Transferred Countries”) had not yet been transferred to us as of the purchase date. The purpose of the Careem\\nQatar and Morocco’s operations is to provide primarily ridesharing services in each respective country. Although the assets and operations of the Non-Transferred\\nCountries were not transferred as of the purchase date, we had rights to all residual interests in the entities comprising the Non-Transferred Countries which was\\nconsidered a variable interest. We were exposed to losses and residual returns of the entities comprising the Non-Transferred Countries through the right to all of\\nthe proceeds from either the divestiture or the eventual legal transfer upon regulatory approval of the entities comprising the Non-Transferred Countries. We\\ncontrolled Intellectual Properties (“IP”) which are significant for the business of Non-Transferred Countries and sub-license those IP to the Non-Transferred\\nCountries. Each entity that comprised the Non-Transferred Countries met the definition of a VIE and we were the primary beneficiary of each of the entities\\ncomprising the Non-Transferred Countries.\\nOn September 21, 2021, ownership of Careem’s operations in Morocco was fully transferred to us. As of December 31, 2021, the assets and operations in\\nCareem Qatar had not been transferred to us. We are exposed to losses and residual returns of the Careem Qatar entity through the right to all of the proceeds from\\neither the divestiture or the eventual legal transfer, upon regulatory approval, of the Careem Qatar entity. We were the primary beneficiary and consolidated Careem\\nQatar as of December 31, 2021.\\nIn October 2022, Qatar’s Court of Cassation rejected our final appeal for the proposed acquisition of the assets and operations of Careem Qatar. However, we\\ncontinue to be the primary beneficiary of Careem Qatar and as a result, we consolidated Careem Qatar as of December 31, 2022.\\nUnconsolidated VIEs\\nWe do not consolidate VIEs in which we hold a variable interest but are not the primary beneficiary because we lack the power to direct the activities that most\\nsignificantly impact the entities’ economic performance. Our carrying amount of assets recognized on the consolidated balance sheets related to unconsolidated\\nVIEs were $598 million and $548 million as of December 31, 2021 and 2022, respectively, and represents our maximum exposure to loss associated with the\\nunconsolidated VIEs.\\nZomato\\n125\\nZomato is incorporated in India with the purposes of providing food delivery services. On January 21, 2020, we acquired compulsorily convertible cumulative\\npreference shares (“CCPS Preferred Shares”) of Zomato valued at $171 million in exchange for Uber’s food delivery operations in India (“Uber Eats India”), and a\\nnote receivable valued at $35 million for reimbursement of goods and services tax. As of December 31, 2020, our investment in the CCPS Preferred Shares of\\nZomato represented 9.99% of the voting capital upon conversion to ordinary shares. Zomato was a VIE as it lacked sufficient equity to finance its activities without\\nfuture subordinated financial support. We were exposed to Zomato’s economic risks and rewards through our investment and note receivable which represent\\nvariable interests, and the carrying values of these variable interests reflect our maximum exposure to loss. However, we were not the primary beneficiary because\\nneither the investment in CCPS Preferred Shares nor the note receivable provide us with the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact Zomato’s\\neconomic performance. Refer to Note 18 – Divestitures for further information regarding Zomato and the divestiture of Uber Eats India.\\nDuring the second quarter of 2021, the outstanding note receivable was paid. During the third quarter of 2021, we determined Zomato is no longer a VIE as it\\nis sufficiently capitalized as a result of its IPO in India during July 2021. During the third quarter of 2022, we completed the sale of our entire stake in Zomato\\nordinary shares. Refer to Note 3 – Investments and Fair Value Measurement for further information.\\nLime\\nNeutron Holdings, Inc. (“Lime”) is incorporated in Delaware for the purpose of owning and operating a fleet of dockless e-bikes and e-scooters for short-term\\naccess use by consumers for personal transportation. On May 7, 2020, we entered into the JUMP Divestiture and received the 2020 Lime Investments. Refer to\\nNote 18 – Divestitures for further information on the JUMP Divestiture and the 2020 Lime Investments. We are exposed to Lime’s economic risks and rewards\\nthrough our ownership of the 2020 Lime Investments, which represent variable interests.\\nCornershop: CS-Mexico\\nAs of December 31, 2020, Cornershop Cayman’s (“Cornershop”) business operations in Mexico (“CS-Mexico”) were determined to be a variable interest. We\\nwere exposed to CS-Mexico’s economic risks and rewards through: the CS-Mexico Put/Call; an immaterial unsecured note; the contractual rights to 35% of\\ncontingent sale proceeds from CS-Mexico under certain conditions; and a market-based fee related to the transition services agreement, all of which represented\\nvariable interests held by Uber. However, we were not the primary beneficiary and we did not consolidate CS-Mexico.\\nIn December 2020, we received approval from Mexico’s antitrust regulator to complete the CS-Mexico transaction. On January 11, 2021, Cornershop Global\\n(“CS-Global”), an entity which held all of Cornershop business operations, except for those in Mexico, exercised a call option and acquired 100% of the\\noutstanding equity interest in CS-Mexico. We owned 55% of CS-Mexico through our ownership in CS-Global. The acquisition of CS-Mexico by CS-Global\\ntriggered a reconsideration event and we reevaluated if CS-Mexico still met the definition of a VIE. As of December 31, 2021, we determined that CS-Mexico was\\nno longer a VIE when it was acquired by CS-Global, which has sufficient equity to operate without the need for subordinated financial support. Refer to Note 17 –\\nBusiness Combinations for further information.\\n126\\nAurora\\nIn January 2021, we sold our ATG Business to Aurora. After the sale, we held equity interests in Aurora through our Aurora Investments. As of December\\xa031,\\n2021, our Aurora Investments had a fair value of $3.4 billion within investments on the consolidated balance sheet. Refer Note 3 – Investments and Fair Value\\nMeasurement for additional information regarding the accounting for our Aurora Investments and Note 18 – Divestitures for additional information regarding the\\nsale of our ATG Business.\\nAfter the sale in January 2021, we initially determined Aurora was a VIE as it lacked sufficient equity to finance its activities without future subordinated\\nfinancial support. We were exposed to Aurora’s economic risks and rewards through our equity interests, which represented variable interests. On November 3,\\n2021, Aurora completed its planned SPAC merger with Reinvent Technology Partners Y, making Aurora a publicly traded company post combination, which\\ntriggered a reconsideration event. We reevaluated if Aurora still met the definition of a VIE and determined that Aurora was no longer a VIE when it completed its\\nSPAC merger given it had sufficient equity to operate without the need for subordinated financial support.\\nMoove\\nOn February 12, 2021 (the “Moove Closing Date”), we entered into and completed a series of agreements with Garment Investments S.L. dba Moove\\n(“Moove”), a vehicle fleet operator in Spain, including (i) an equity investment, through preferred shares, in which Uber acquired a 30% minority interest in\\nMoove from its current shareholders at closing and up to approximately $185 million contingent on future performance of Moove and certain other conditions\\nthrough the eighth anniversary of the agreement, (ii) a term loan of $213 million to Moove, due February 2026, and (iii) a commercial partnership agreement. Also\\nincluded in the agreements is an option for us to purchase common stock of Moove at fair value, beginning two years after the Moove Close Date. After this series\\nof agreements, Moove is considered a related party.\\nOur equity investment in Moove, through preferred shares, is accounted for as an investment in non-marketable equity securities included in investments on\\nthe consolidated balance sheets. The term loan, $215 million as of December 31, 2022, is accounted for as a loan receivable, carried at amortized cost, and included\\nin other assets on the consolidated balance sheet. Refer to Note 3 – Investments and Fair Value Measurement, Assets Measured at Fair Value on a Non-Recurring\\nBasis, for additional information regarding our non-marketable equity securities.\\nMoove is a VIE as it lacks sufficient equity to finance its activities without future subordinated financial support. We are exposed to Moove’s economic risks\\nand rewards through our equity investment, the term loan and commercial partnership agreement, which represent variable interests.\\n127\\nNote 16 – Non-Controlling Interests\\nWe have several consolidated subsidiaries that have issued common stock and preferred stock or preferred units to third party investors, representing non-\\ncontrolling interests. As of December 31, 2021 and 2022, the amounts of non-controlling interests represented by subsidiaries’ preferred units and preferred stock\\nwere $1.0 billion and $1.3 billion, respectively.\\nATG Investment: Preferred Unit Purchase Agreement\\nDuring 2019, we closed a Preferred Unit Purchase Agreement with SoftBank, Toyota, and DENSO (collectively “the Investors”) for purchase by the Investors\\nof Class A Preferred Units (“Preferred Units”) in Apparate. Apparate, a subsidiary of ours, issued 1.0 million Preferred Units at $1,000 per unit to the Investors for\\nan aggregate consideration of $1.0 billion ($400 million from Toyota, $333 million from SoftBank, and $267 million from DENSO). As of December 31, 2020, the\\nPreferred Units represented an aggregate 14.2% ownership interest in Apparate on an as-converted basis and we retained the remaining 85.8% ownership interest.\\nAt the option of the Investors, the Preferred Units were convertible into common units of Apparate, initially on a one-for-one basis but subject to potential\\nadjustment, as defined by the Preferred Unit Purchase Agreement at any time. The Preferred Units were entitled to certain distributions, including primarily\\ndividends which are payable in cash or in-kind (at Apparate\\'s discretion), and accrue quarterly, compounded on the last day of each quarter at a 4.5% annual rate.\\nThe Preferred Units were entitled to distributions upon the occurrence of a sale or liquidation of Apparate representing an amount that is equal to the greater of (i)\\nthe original investment plus any accrued but unpaid amounts, and (ii) their share of distributions assuming conversion to common units of Apparate immediately\\nprior to the sale or liquidation event. The quarterly dividend, along with any attributed prorated share of Apparate’s net income (if applicable), were included in net\\nincome (loss) attributable to non-controlling interests, net of tax in our consolidated statements of operations. The Preferred Units did not participate in net losses\\ndue to a liquidation preference.\\nSoftBank’s Preferred Units\\nSoftBank’s Preferred Units included the option to put to us all, but not less than all, of its initial investment in Preferred Units at a price equal to the number of\\nSoftBank’s Preferred Units multiplied by the greater of (i) the original investment plus any accrued but unpaid amounts per unit and (ii) the fair value of the\\nPreferred Units at the time of conversion (the “Put/Call Price”). In addition, we also had the option to call all, but not less than all, of the Preferred Units held by\\nSoftBank at the Put/Call Price. The put and call were determined to be embedded features within the SoftBank Preferred Units since they were not separately\\nexercisable or legally detached from the SoftBank Preferred Units. As of December 31, 2020, the SoftBank Preferred Units were classified as redeemable non-\\ncontrolling interests in our consolidated financial statements and reported at the Put/Call Price which was determined as of the balance sheet date.\\nToyota and DENSO’s Preferred Units\\nAs of December 31, 2020, the Toyota and DENSO Preferred Units were classified as non-redeemable non-controlling interests as these units were not subject\\nto any mandatory redemption rights or redemption rights that are outside our control.\\nDivestiture of ATG Business to Aurora\\nOn January 19, 2021, we completed the previously announced sale of our ATG Business to Aurora. As a result, our controlling interest and the non-controlling\\ninterests in the ATG Business were settled and ownership of the ATG Business transferred to Aurora. We derecognized the carrying value of non-controlling\\ninterests in the ATG Business of $1.1 billion, which included Toyota and DENSO non-redeemable non-controlling interests of $701 million and Softbank’s\\nredeemable non-controlling interests of $356 million. Refer to Note 18 – Divestitures for further information.\\nFreight Holding\\nAs of December 31, 2021 and 2022, we owned 78% and 74%, respectively, of the issued and outstanding capital stock of our subsidiary Freight Holding, or\\n75% and 73%, respectively, on a fully-diluted basis if all common shares reserved for issuance under our Freight Holding employee incentive plan were issued and\\noutstanding.\\nIn May 2022, Freight Holding adopted the 2022 Freight Holding Equity Incentive Plan (the “2022 Freight Holding Plan”). The 2022 Freight Holding Plan\\nserves as the successor to the 2018 Holding Equity Incentive Plan (the “2018 Freight Holding Plan”). Awards previously granted under the 2018 Freight Holding\\nPlan remain outstanding and governed by the terms of the 2018 Freight Holding Plan.\\nAs of December\\xa031, 2021 under the 2018 Freight Holding Plan a total number of 99.8 million shares of Freight Holding were reserved, of which 85.0 million\\nshares were available for grant and issuance.\\nAs of December\\xa031, 2022 under the 2022 Freight Holding Plan a total number of 85.1 million shares of Freight Holding were reserved, of which 39.4 million\\nshares were available for grant and issuance.\\nThe redeemable non-controlling interest of Freight Holding is not accreted to redemption value because it is currently not probable that the non-controlling\\ninterest will become redeemable.\\n128\\nHolders of Common Stock of Freight Holding\\nThe minority common stockholders of our subsidiary Freight Holding, including any holders of common equity awards issued under the employee equity\\nincentive plans and employees who hold fully vested shares, have put rights to sell certain of their equity interests at fair value to us at specified periods of time that\\nterminates upon the earliest of the closing of a liquidation transaction or an IPO of the subsidiary. Should the put rights be exercised, they can be satisfied in either\\ncash, Uber stock, or a combination of cash and Uber stock based upon our election. As of December 31, 2021 and 2022, the minority common stockholders\\nownership in Freight Holding is classified as a redeemable non-controlling interest, because it is redeemable on an event that is not solely in our control.\\nWe attribute the pro rata share of the Freight Holding’s net income or loss available to holders of common stock to the redeemable non-controlling interests\\ngenerated from common shares of Freight Holding based on the outstanding ownership of the minority shareholders of common shares during the period.\\nFreight Series A Preferred Stock\\nIn October 2020, Freight Holding entered into a 2020 Freight Series A Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement with a 2020 Freight Series A Investor. Pursuant to\\nthe 2020 Freight Series A Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement, the 2020 Freight Series A Investor agreed to invest an aggregate of $500 million in Freight\\nHolding, which occurred over two closings, subject to customary closing conditions.\\nThe 2020 Freight Series A Investor had the option to purchase additional shares in tranches of at least $50 million at a time at the initial purchase price for two\\nyears following initial closing up to an additional aggregate $250 million. This right to continue to invest at the initial price over two years is a forward obligation\\nclassified was a liability measured at fair value which was initially valued using a two-year discount rate and was immaterial. We maintain majority ownership of\\nthe issued and outstanding capital stock of Freight Holding following such additional investment. Upon the passage of two years from initial close, the 2020\\nFreight Series A Investor must purchase and Freight Holding must issue any remaining unissued additional shares at the purchase price. The 2020 Freight Series A\\nInvestor holds two seats on the Freight Holding board of directors as of December 31, 2022.\\nIn October 2020, the initial closing occurred pursuant to the 2020 Freight Series A Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement and 2020 Freight Series A Investor\\ninvested $250 million in exchange for 124.7 million shares of Freight Series A preferred stock, representing approximately 8% ownership interest on a fully diluted\\nbasis.\\nIn August 2022, the second closing occurred pursuant to the Freight Series A Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement and the 2020 Freight Series A Investor\\ninvested an additional $250 million in exchange for 124.7 million shares of Freight Series A preferred stock. The 2020 Freight Series A Investor is considered a\\nrelated party to Freight Holding.\\nWe do not attribute the pro rata share of the Freight Holding’s loss to the redeemable non-controlling interests in Series A Preferred shares of Freight Holding\\nbecause these shares are entitled to a liquidation preference and therefore do not participate in losses that would cause their interest to be below the liquidation\\npreference. Upon liquidation, these Freight Series A preferred stock are entitled to the greater of either (i) a 1.5x liquidation preference on their initial investment,\\nas well as 6% continuously compounding cumulative dividends that will be paid before any distribution to common shareholders or (ii) the fair value of their\\ninvestment (the “Freight Series A Liquidation Preference”). The dividend, along with any attributed prorated share of Freight Holding’s net income (if applicable),\\nare included in net income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interests, net of tax in our consolidated statements of operations.\\nThe 2020 Freight Series A Investor’s Freight Series A preferred stock may be called by us at our option after the passage of five years at the Freight Series A\\nLiquidation Preference. Beginning after three years, if a series of events occur including Freight Holding not consummating an IPO, 2020 Freight Series A\\nInvestor’s Freight Series A preferred stock could become redeemable at the Freight Series A Liquidation Preference upon the passage of five years. Upon\\nredemption, the 2020 Freight Series A Investor’s Freight Series A preferred stock would be settled in either cash or Uber common shares at our option.\\nIn July 2021, we entered into a Series A preferred stock purchase agreement and sold shares of Freight Holding\\'s Series A Preferred Stock to The Public\\nInvestment Fund, which is an investor in Uber, representing 4% ownership interest on a fully diluted basis at the time of the sale. As of December 31, 2021 and\\n2022, the Freight Series A preferred stock held by the Public Investment Fund were classified as non-redeemable non-controlling interests as these shares of\\npreferred stock are not subject to any mandatory redemption rights or redemption rights that are outside our control.\\nFreight Series A-1 Preferred Stock\\n129\\nIn November 2021, Freight Holding entered into a 2021 Series A-1 Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement with Freight Series A-1 Investors. Pursuant to the\\n2021 Series A-1 Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement, the Freight Series A-1 Investors agreed to invest an aggregate of $550 million in Freight Holding in\\nexchange for Freight Series A-1 preferred stock. The purchase and sale of the Freight Series A-1 preferred stock took place concurrently with the closing of the\\nTransplace acquisition. Refer to Note 17 – Business Combinations for additional information on the Transplace acquisition.\\nFreight Series A-1 Investors have basic rights and preferences which primarily include: one vote per share; conversion rights to common shares; 6%\\ncumulative dividend preference and liquidation preference (a 1.0x liquidation preference of original issuance price plus cumulative unpaid dividends). The accruing\\ndividends are compounding annually, and are only payable when dividends are declared by Freight Holding’s Board. The dividend, along with any attributed\\nprorated share of Freight Holding’s net income (if applicable), are included in net income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interests, net of tax in our\\nconsolidated statements of operations. As of December 31, 2021 and 2022, the Freight Series A-1 preferred stock held by the Freight Series A-1 Investors were\\nclassified as non-redeemable non-controlling interests as these shares of preferred stock are not subject to any mandatory redemption rights or redemption rights\\nthat are outside our control.\\nCornershop\\nOn July 6, 2020, we closed the acquisition of a 55% controlling ownership interest in CS-Global. Refer to Note 17 – Business Combinations for further\\ninformation. As of December 31, 2020, the non-controlling interest in CS-Global was classified as redeemable non-controlling interest because it is subject to a\\nput/call agreement which was not solely in our control to exercise. At each balance sheet date, the redeemable non-controlling interest was measured using a\\ndiscounted cash flow methodology and the carrying value was adjusted if the fair value was higher than the carrying value. The initial fair value, as of the\\nacquisition date of July 6, 2020, was $290 million. There were no fair value adjustments to CS-Global’s\\xa0redeemable non-controlling interest during the year ended\\nDecember 31, 2020. As of December 31, 2020, Cornershop’s financial results were consolidated in our consolidated financial statements given our majority\\nownership interest.\\nOn January 11, 2021, CS-Global exercised a call option and acquired 100% of the outstanding equity interest in CS-Mexico, which increased the redeemable\\nnon-controlling interest. In August 2021, we acquired the minority shareholders\\' interests in CS-Global in an all-stock transaction and CS-Global became a wholly-\\nowned subsidiary of ours. We derecognized the carrying value of redeemable non-controlling interests in CS-Global of $1.3 billion. Refer to Note 17 – Business\\nCombinations for further information.\\nNote 17 – Business Combinations\\nCareem\\nOn January\\xa02, 2020, we completed the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of Careem. Dubai-based Careem was founded in 2012, and provides\\nprimarily ridesharing and to a lesser extent meal delivery, and payments services to millions of users in cities across the Middle East, North Africa, and Pakistan.\\nThe acquisition was accounted for as a business combination and advances our strategy of having a leading ridesharing category position in every major region of\\nthe world in which we operate and effect cost and technology synergies for the rest of Uber’s Mobility business. On September\\xa021, 2021, ownership of Careem’s\\noperations in Morocco was fully transferred to us. As of December 31, 2021 and 2022, ownership of Careem’s operations in Qatar had not be transferred to us;\\nhowever the results of operations and net assets were fully consolidated as variable interest entities. Refer to Note 15 – Variable Interest Entities for further\\ninformation.\\nThe acquisition date fair value of the consideration transferred for Careem was $3.0 billion, which consisted of the following (in millions):\\nFair Value\\nCash paid on January 2, 2020\\n$\\n1,326\\xa0\\nNon-interest bearing unsecured convertible notes\\n1,634\\xa0\\nTransaction costs paid on January 2, 2020 on behalf of Careem\\n39\\xa0\\nContingent cash consideration\\n1\\xa0\\nStock-based compensation awards attributable to pre-combination services\\n3\\xa0\\nTotal consideration\\n$\\n3,003\\xa0\\nThe fair value of the Careem Notes was determined as a sum of the discounted cash flow (“DCF”) method (for the present value of the principal amount of the\\nCareem Notes) and the Black-Scholes option pricing model (to value the conversion option). The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value\\nmeasurement include discount rates of 5.14% to 5.19% for the principal amount of the Careem Notes and for the conversion option an expected volatility of 42.1%\\nto 44.1%, interest rates of 1.53% to 1.57%, and dividend yield of 0%. We issued the Careem Notes in different tranches with $880 million of the principal amount\\nof the Careem Notes issued on January\\xa02, 2020 and settled in cash on April\\xa01, 2020. Each tranche of the Careem Notes is due and payable 90 days once issued. The\\nholders of the Careem Notes may elect to convert the full outstanding principal balance to Class A common stock at a conversion price of $55 per share of Uber\\nTechnologies, Inc. at any time prior to maturity. The discount from the Careem Notes face value to fair value will be accreted through the respective repayment\\ndates as interest expense.\\n130\\nDuring the year ended December\\xa031, 2021, certain holders of the Careem Notes elected to convert their notes and as a result of such elections, $539 million of\\nthe principal amount of the Careem Notes matured, of which $307 million were settled in cash and $232 million were settled in equity. During the year ended\\nDecember 31, 2022, certain holders of the Careem Notes elected to convert their notes, resulting in immaterial amounts settled in cash and equity.\\nThe remaining amount of the Careem Notes is recognized as a commitment to issue unsecured convertible notes at fair value in accrued and other current\\nliabilities of $152 million as of December\\xa031, 2022. The amount of accretion for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2022 was not material.\\nCareem: Acquisition Date Fair Value\\nThe following table summarizes the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the date of acquisition (in millions):\\nFair Value\\nCurrent assets\\n$\\n43\\xa0\\nGoodwill\\n2,483\\xa0\\nIntangible assets\\n540\\xa0\\nOther long-term assets\\n77\\xa0\\nTotal assets acquired\\n3,143\\xa0\\nCurrent liabilities\\n(108)\\nDeferred tax liability\\n(13)\\nOther long-term liabilities\\n(19)\\nTotal liabilities assumed\\n(140)\\nNet assets acquired\\n$\\n3,003\\xa0\\nThe excess of purchase consideration over the fair value of net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired was recorded as goodwill which is not\\ndeductible for tax purposes. Goodwill is primarily attributed to the assembled workforce of Careem and anticipated operational synergies. Goodwill was recorded\\nin our Mobility segment. The fair values assigned to tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed are based on management’s\\nestimates and assumptions at the time of acquisition.\\nThe following table sets forth the components of identifiable intangible assets acquired and their estimated useful lives as of the date of acquisition (in\\nmillions, except years):\\nFair Value\\nWeighted Average Remaining\\nUseful Life - Years\\nRider relationships\\n$\\n270\\xa0\\n15\\nCaptains network\\n40\\xa0\\n1\\nDeveloped technology\\n110\\xa0\\n4\\nTrade names\\n120\\xa0\\n10\\nTotal\\n$\\n540\\xa0\\nRider relationships represent the fair value of the underlying relationships with Careem riders. Captains network represents the fair value of the underlying\\nnetwork with Careem drivers (called “Captains”). Developed technology represents the fair value of Careem’s technology. Trade names relate to the “Careem”\\ntrade name, trademarks, and domain names. The overall weighted average useful life of the identified amortizable intangible assets acquired is ten years.\\nTangible net assets were valued at their respective carrying amounts as of the acquisition date, as we believe that these amounts approximate their current fair\\nvalues. We believe the amounts of purchased intangible assets recorded above represent the fair values of, and approximate the amounts a market participant would\\npay for, these intangible assets as of January\\xa02, 2020.\\nThe Asset Purchase Agreement provides for specific indemnities to us in relation to value added tax obligations and other tax reserves of certain jurisdictions\\nwhich reflect potential tax liabilities. We recognized $64 million of indemnification assets on the same basis as the tax reserves at January\\xa02, 2020, which is\\nrecorded as other assets and other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet. Settlements of these tax reserves, if any, will be funded by the indemnification asset.\\nThe results of the acquired operations were included in our consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition, January\\xa02, 2020. For the period from\\nJanuary\\xa02, 2020 through December\\xa031, 2020, Careem contributed to a loss before income taxes of $218 million. Revenue for the period from January\\xa02, 2020\\nthrough December\\xa031, 2020 were not material.\\nCornershop\\n131\\nIn 2019, as a strategic move of entering into grocery delivery market, we agreed to purchase a controlling interest in Cornershop Cayman (“Cornershop”),\\noperating an online grocery delivery platform primarily in Chile and Mexico. During 2019, we made an initial investment of $50 million (the “Initial Cornershop\\nInvestment”). The remaining investment was subject to antitrust approval of the countries where Cornershop operates.\\nDuring the second quarter of 2020, we received regulatory approvals, except for Mexico. As a result, we and Cornershop amended the terms of the agreement\\nin order for Uber to acquire Cornershop’s business operations, except for those in Mexico. Immediately prior to the transaction close, Cornershop was restructured\\nsuch that the Mexico operations were held in Cornershop Technologies LLC and its wholly-owned subsidiary (collectively referred to as “CS-Mexico”), while all\\nof the remaining Cornershop operations were to be held in the newly created CS-Global entity.\\nOn July\\xa06, 2020, we acquired 55% controlling interest in CS-Global, an entity which held all of Cornershop’s business operations, except for those in Mexico.\\nThis transaction resulted in an Uber direct capital contribution of $200 million, which included the Initial Cornershop Investment and notes receivable, to CS-\\nGlobal and a payment of $179 million to tendering shareholders, paid in a combination of cash and 2,055,038 shares of our common stock. The Initial Cornershop\\nInvestment was remeasured immediately prior to the acquisition of CS-Global, and based on the Cornershop business value and Uber’s pre-acquisition ownership\\npercentage, the new value was not materially different from the previously recognized amount. Thus, the Initial Cornershop Investment was determined at the\\noriginal $50 million. In exchange for the consideration transferred, we received 15,642,523 Preferred C Membership Interests in CS-Global, representing 55% of\\nthe outstanding membership interests. As a result, we obtained the controlling financial interest in CS-Global and accounted for the acquisition as a business\\ncombination. Concurrent with the CS-Global acquisition transaction, Uber, Cornershop and CS-Global entered into a put/call arrangement over the non-controlling\\ninterest in CS-Global, providing CS-Global with the right through the call option (and obligation through the put option held by Cornershop) to purchase all of the\\ninterests in CS-Mexico, contingent upon the receipt of regulatory approval in Mexico (“CS-Mexico Put/Call”). Upon either the exercise of the call option (by CS-\\nGlobal) or the put option (by Cornershop), CS-Global would acquire 100% of the outstanding equity interests in CS-Mexico. Uber would make a direct capital\\ncontribution to CS-Global and a payment to the tendering shareholder, totaling $94 million, in exchange for 55% outstanding equity interest in CS-Mexico. The\\nCS-Mexico Put/Call, which was exercisable in 5 years if there is no IPO or liquidation event, at a future negotiated price, was accounted for separately from the\\nacquisition, and was included in other current assets on the consolidated balance sheet as of December\\xa031, 2020.\\nThe acquisition date fair value of the consideration transferred for CS-Global was $362 million, which consisted of the following (in millions):\\nFair Value\\nInitial Cornershop Investment\\n$\\n50\\xa0\\nNotes receivable\\n10\\xa0\\nCash paid\\n253\\xa0\\nTender offer paid in Uber common stock\\n67\\xa0\\nTotal consideration transferred\\n380\\xa0\\nLess: CS-Mexico Put/Call\\n(18)\\nTotal consideration\\n$\\n362\\xa0\\nThe following table summarizes the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the date of acquisition (in millions):\\nFair Value\\nCurrent assets\\n$\\n204\\xa0\\nGoodwill\\n384\\xa0\\nIntangible assets\\n122\\xa0\\nOther long-term assets\\n11\\xa0\\nTotal assets acquired\\n721\\xa0\\nCurrent liabilities\\n(34)\\nDeferred tax liability\\n(33)\\nOther long-term liabilities\\n(2)\\nTotal liabilities assumed\\n(69)\\nLess: Redeemable non-controlling interests\\n(290)\\nNet assets acquired\\n$\\n362\\xa0\\nThe excess of purchase consideration over the fair value of net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired was recorded as goodwill which is not\\ndeductible for tax purposes.

The fair values assigned to tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed are based on\\nmanagement\\'s estimates and assumptions at the time of acquisition, and are updated to reflect the most recent changes.\\nThe fair value of the redeemable non-controlling interests of $290 million was estimated based on the non-controlling interest’s respective share of the CS-\\nGlobal enterprise value.\\nThe following table sets forth the components of identifiable intangible assets acquired and their estimated useful lives as of the date of acquisition (in\\nmillions, except years):\\nFair Value\\nWeighted Average Remaining\\nUseful Life - Years\\nVendor relationship\\n$\\n20\\xa0\\n15\\nShopper relationship\\n1\\xa0\\n1\\nCustomer relationship\\n14\\xa0\\n5\\nDeveloped technology\\n58\\xa0\\n4\\nTrade names\\n29\\xa0\\n5\\nTotal\\n$\\n122\\xa0\\nVendor, shopper and customer relationships represent the fair value of the underlying relationships with Cornershop vendors (such as grocery stores and\\nsupermarkets), shoppers and end-users. Developed technology represents the fair value of the technologies and systems behind CS-Global’s grocery delivery\\napplication. Trade names relate to the “Cornershop” trade name, trademarks, and domain names. The overall weighted average useful life of the identified\\namortizable intangible assets acquired is six years.\\nTangible net assets were valued at their respective carrying amounts as of the acquisition date, as we believe that these amounts approximate their current fair\\nvalues. We believe the amounts of purchased intangible assets recorded above represent the fair values of, and approximate the amounts a market participant would\\npay for, these intangible assets as of July\\xa06, 2020.\\nThe results of CS-Global were included in our consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition, July\\xa06, 2020. For the period from July\\xa06, 2020\\nthrough December\\xa031, 2020, CS-Global contributed an immaterial amount of revenue and loss before taxes.\\nIn December 2020, we received approval from Mexico’s antitrust regulator to complete the CS-Mexico transaction. On January\\xa011, 2021, CS-Global exercised\\nthe call option through the CS-Mexico Put/Call agreement and acquired 100% of the outstanding equity interest in CS-Mexico, and we owned 55% of CS-Mexico\\nthrough our ownership in CS-Global. The acquisition of CS-Mexico was accounted for as a business combination. The acquisition date fair value of the\\nconsideration transferred for CS-Mexico was immaterial, and consisted of a combination of cash payment and equity payment in Uber common stock and the fair\\nvalue of the CS-Mexico Put/Call remeasured at the acquisition date. As a result of remeasuring our prior CS-Mexico Put/Call held immediately prior to the\\nbusiness combination, we recognized an immaterial loss during the year ended December\\xa031, 2021. The loss was included in other income (expense), net in the\\nconsolidated statement of operations.\\nIn August 2021, we completed the acquisition of the remaining 45% ownership interest (or 47%, on a fully-diluted basis) in Cornershop in an all-stock\\ntransaction. As consideration for our acquisition of the remaining non-controlling interest, we issued 25 million shares of our common stock, including 4.6 million\\nrestricted shares issued to certain Cornershop employees. In addition, we issued 4 million stock options to replace assumed outstanding stock options. These\\nreplacement stock options attributable to post-acquisition service were included in our option activity and were recognized as stock-based compensation expense.\\nThe acquisition was accounted for as an equity transaction, as we previously controlled and consolidated Cornershop. Accordingly, we did not recognize a gain\\nor loss in our consolidated statement of operations during the year ended December 31, 2021. In connection with this acquisition, the previously recognized non-\\ncontrolling interest was derecognized. Following this transaction, Cornershop became our wholly-owned subsidiary.\\nThe total purchase price was determined to be $967 million, based on the number of shares issued and Uber’s share price on the closing date. The fair value of\\nthe 4.6 million restricted shares issued to certain Cornershop employees was determined to be $202 million. These shares are restricted and contingent on the\\nemployees’ continuing employment at the combined company for three years, beginning in August 2021. These restricted shares are considered compensation for\\npost-combination services and will be recognized as stock-based compensation expense ratably over three years.\\nPostmates\\nOn July\\xa05, 2020, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger to acquire 100% ownership interest in Postmates, an on-demand delivery platform in the\\nU.S.\\nOn December\\xa01, 2020, we completed the acquisition of Postmates, bringing together our global Mobility and Delivery platform with Postmates’ distinctive\\ndelivery business in the U.S. As a result of the transaction, we obtained ownership interest in Postmates\\n133\\nthrough our voting rights, and the transaction was accounted for as a business combination. The acquisition date fair value of the consideration transferred for\\nPostmates was approximately $3.9 billion, which consisted of the following (in millions):\\nFair Value\\nUber common stock transferred\\n$\\n3,494\\xa0\\nNote receivable\\n100\\xa0\\nStock-based compensation awards attributable to pre-combination services\\n308\\xa0\\nTotal consideration\\n$\\n3,902\\xa0\\nThe fair value of the $3.5 billion common stock issued (70 million shares of our common stock), as consideration transferred was determined on the basis of\\nthe closing market price of our common stock on the acquisition date. We determined the fair value of the equity awards for stock options assumed using a Black-\\nScholes option pricing model with the applicable assumptions as of the acquisition date. The fair value of equity awards for RSUs was determined by using the\\nclosing market price of our common stock on the acquisition date adjusted by an exchange ratio.\\nThe following table summarizes the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the date of acquisition (in millions):\\nFair Value\\nCash and cash equivalents\\n$\\n52\\xa0\\nOther current assets\\n58\\xa0\\nGoodwill\\n3,330\\xa0\\nIntangible assets\\n1,015\\xa0\\nOther long-term assets\\n57\\xa0\\nTotal assets acquired\\n4,512\\xa0\\nAccounts payable\\n(109)\\nAccrued and other current liabilities\\n(458)\\nDeferred tax liability\\n(9)\\nOther long-term liabilities\\n(34)\\nTotal liabilities assumed\\n(610)\\nNet assets acquired\\n$\\n3,902\\xa0\\nThe excess of purchase consideration over the fair value of net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired was recorded as goodwill, which is not\\ndeductible for tax purposes.

The unaudited pro forma information\\npresented below is for informational purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of our consolidated results of operations of the consolidated business had the\\nacquisitions actually occurred at the beginning of applicable comparable prior reporting period or of the results of our future operations of the consolidated\\nbusiness.\\nYear Ended December 31,\\n(In millions)\\n2020\\n2021\\n(Unaudited)\\nRevenue\\n$\\n15,158\\xa0\\n$\\n21,764\\xa0\\nNet loss including non-controlling interests\\n(7,342)\\n(700)\\nThe pro forma financial information primarily includes adjustments to net loss including non-controlling interests to reflect the additional amortization that\\nwould have been recorded assuming the fair value adjustments to intangible assets had been applied from the beginning of applicable comparable prior reporting\\nperiod, with the related tax effects.\\nNote 18 – Divestitures\\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2020, 2021 and 2022, we completed the following divestitures:\\n•\\nIn 2020, divestitures consisted of the sale of our Uber Eats India operations, the disposition of all assets of our JUMP business, and the sale of our\\nEuropean Freight business to Sennder.\\n•\\nIn 2021, divestitures consisted of the sale of our ATG Business, a subsidiary focused on the development and commercialization of autonomous vehicle\\ntechnology, to Aurora.\\nThe gains (losses) associated with these divestitures were included in other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations.\\nDivestiture of Uber Eats India to Zomato\\nOn January 21, 2020, we entered into a definitive agreement and completed the divestiture of Uber Eats India to Zomato in exchange for (i) CCPS Preferred\\nShares of Zomato convertible into ordinary shares representing, when converted, 9.99% of the total voting capital of Zomato and (ii) a non-interest bearing note\\nreceivable to be repaid over the course of four years for reimbursement by Zomato of goods and services tax. The estimated fair value of the consideration received\\nincluded the investment valued at $171\\xa0million and the $35\\xa0million of reimbursement of goods and services tax receivable from Zomato. As of December 31, 2021,\\nwe had collected substantially all of the receivable. The fair value of the CCPS Preferred Shares was based primarily on the observed transaction price for a similar\\nsecurity issued to new investors in close proximity to the time of our transaction with Zomato. The transaction resulted in a gain on disposal of $154\\xa0million\\nrecognized in other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations during the first quarter of 2020. The income tax effect of the sale was not\\nmaterial. The divestiture of Uber Eats India did not represent a strategic shift that would have had a major effect on our operations and financial results, and\\ntherefore does not qualify for reporting as a discontinued operation for financial statement purposes.\\nDivestiture of JUMP and Investment in Lime\\nOn May 7, 2020, we entered into a series of transactions and agreements with Lime to divest our JUMP business (the “JUMP Divestiture”). Lime is\\nincorporated in Delaware for the purpose of owning and operating a fleet of dockless e-bikes and e-scooters for short-term access use by consumers for personal\\ntransportation. We previously held Lime Series C preferred stock and fully vested warrants to purchase Lime Series C-1 preferred stock.\\nUber contributed hardware, equipment, intellectual property rights, technology, licensed technology, and permits of our JUMP business (collectively, “JUMP\\nAssets”) in certain markets to Lime. JUMP Assets and previously held investments and warrants in Lime were exchanged for common stock (the “Lime Common\\nStock”), newly issued Lime Series 1-C preferred stock (“Lime 1-C Preferred Stock”) and fully vested warrants to purchase Lime Series 1-C Preferred Stock (“Lime\\n1-C Preferred Stock Warrants”). Lime Common Stock represents approximately 10% of fully-diluted (22% undiluted) ownership interest in Lime as of December\\n31, 2022.\\n137\\nConcurrently, we contributed $85\\xa0 million of cash to Lime in exchange for a secured note convertible into Lime Series 3 Preferred Stock (the “Lime\\nConvertible Note”), which may be converted at any time at our election representing 20% initial ownership in Lime as converted on a fully-diluted basis. In\\naddition, we entered into a call option agreement which gives us for a two-year period beginning May 7, 2022 the right to acquire all of the outstanding equity\\ninterests of Lime held by its shareholders at fair value on the date of exercise, subject to regulatory approval. We have one seat on Lime’s five-person board of\\ndirectors. We also amended our preexisting commercial agreement with Lime.\\nOur ownership in Lime is comprised of Lime Common Stock, Lime 1-C Preferred Stock, Lime 1-C Preferred Stock Warrants, and the Lime Convertible Note\\n(collectively, the “2020 Lime Investments”) and represents approximately 30% on an as converted and fully-diluted basis as of December 31, 2022. The 2020 Lime\\nInvestments are accounted for under the fair value option. Refer to Note 3 - Investments and Fair Value Measurement for additional information. Lime was\\nassessed under the VIE model and considered an unconsolidated VIE. Refer to Note 15 – Variable Interest Entities for additional information.\\nThe JUMP Divestiture did not represent a strategic shift that would cause a major effect on our operations and financial results, and therefore does not qualify\\nfor reporting as a discontinued operation for financial reporting purposes. The resulting loss on disposal was not material to us and was recorded in other income\\n(expense), net, in the consolidated statements of operations during the second quarter of 2020.\\nDivestiture of ATG Business to Aurora\\nOn January 19, 2021, we completed the previously announced sale of our ATG Business, a subsidiary focused on the development and commercialization of\\nautonomous vehicle technology, to Aurora. As a result, our controlling interest and the non-controlling interests in the ATG Business were settled, and ownership of\\nthe ATG Business transferred to Aurora.\\nAs consideration for the sale, Aurora issued Series U-1 preferred shares to the third party investors of the ATG Business to settle their ATG Series A Stated\\nLiquidation Preference of $1.1 billion, which had previously been recorded as redeemable and non-redeemable non-controlling interests on our consolidated\\nbalance sheet prior to this transaction. We received the residual consideration from the sale as the only common unit holder of the ATG Business in the form of\\nAurora common shares valued at $1.3 billion, representing 22% of fully-diluted (25% undiluted) ownership interest of Aurora. Concurrently, we invested $400\\nmillion in Aurora in exchange for Aurora Series U-2 convertible preferred shares, representing 4% of fully-diluted (5% undiluted) ownership interest of Aurora.\\nRefer to Note 3 – Investments and Fair Value Measurement for additional information.\\nWe do not consolidate Aurora under either the VIE or the voting interest model. For further information, refer to Note 15 – Variable Interest Entities.\\nWe entered into a commercial agreement with Aurora pursuant to which the parties will collaborate with best efforts to launch and commercialize self-driving\\nvehicles on our ridesharing network. We also allowed unvested RSUs for Uber stock held by employees of the ATG Business that transferred to Aurora to continue\\nto vest over the next 12 months contingent upon the employee remaining at Aurora. As a result, we recognized liabilities of $315 million as consideration for these\\nfuture obligations to Aurora.\\nThe sale of the ATG Business did not represent a strategic shift that would have had a major effect on our operations and financial results, and therefore does\\nnot qualify for reporting as a discontinued operation.

For additional information on the loss portfolio\\ntransfer reinsurance agreement, see Note 1 – Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.\\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, the increase in the valuation allowance was primarily attributable to an increase in tax rate in the Netherlands, an\\nincrease in U.S. federal, state and Netherlands deferred tax assets resulting from the loss from operations, and tax credits generated during the year.\\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, the increase in the valuation allowance was primarily attributable to a tax rate increase in the Netherlands, an increase\\nin U.S. federal, state and Netherlands deferred tax assets resulting from the loss from operations, and tax credits generated during the year, offset partially by the\\nrelease of the valuation allowance due to deferred tax liabilities recorded as a result of the acquisitions providing an additional source of taxable income to support\\nthe realizability of pre-existing deferred tax assets.\\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, the increase in the valuation allowance was primarily attributable to an increase in deferred tax assets resulting from\\nthe loss from operations, offset by the deferred tax impact from the transfer of certain intangible assets among our wholly-owned subsidiaries.\\nITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE\\nNone.\\nITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\\nWe maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in reports that we\\nfile or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time\\nperiods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management,\\nincluding our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure. As required by Rule\\n13a-15(b) under the Exchange Act, our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our\\ndisclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive\\nOfficer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our disclosure controls and procedures\\nare effective at a reasonable assurance level.\\n(1), (2)\\n(2)\\n(1) \\n(2) \\n140\\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\\nThere were no changes to our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended December\\xa031, 2022 that have materially affected,\\nor are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\\nInherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls\\nOur management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, believes that our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control\\nover financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and are effective at the reasonable assurance level. However, our\\nmanagement does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all error and fraud.\\nAny control system, no matter how well designed and operated, is based upon certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that its\\nobjectives will be met. Further, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control\\nissues and instances of fraud, if any, within our company have been detected.\\nManagement\\'s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the\\nExchange Act). Our management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria established in\\n“Internal Control - Integrated Framework” (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”). Based on that\\nassessment, our management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December\\xa0 31, 2022. In addition,\\nPricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm, provided an attestation report on our internal control over financial reporting as\\nof December\\xa031, 2022.
